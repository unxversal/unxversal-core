# Audit: unxvtradervaults

## Current On-Chain Approach
- **Vault Listing:** Anyone can create a new trader vault (permissionless for managers).
- **Trading:** Vault managers control trading, investors deposit capital, and profit sharing is enforced.
- **Orderbook:** No direct orderbook, but vaults could interact with DEX/DeepBook for trading.

## Proper Permissionless Orderbook Approach
- **Vault Listing:** Already permissionless for vault creation.
- **Orderbook:** Allow vaults to interact with DeepBook/DEX for orderbook-based trading.

## Recommended Architectural Changes
- No major changes needed; protocol is already permissionless for vault creation.
- Consider adding more hooks for vaults to interact with DEX/orderbooks.

## Observations
- Protocol is robust and permissionless for its intended use-case.
- No major architectural flaws.
