# UnXversal Options Protocol

## Overview

The UnXversal Options Protocol enables decentralized trading of European and American-style options on crypto assets. The protocol provides sophisticated options trading functionality with accurate pricing models, Greeks calculations, and risk management, all built on the Sui blockchain.

---

## On-Chain Architecture

### Core Components

- **OptionsRegistry**: Central registry managing supported assets, pricing models, risk parameters, and UNXV discount tiers
- **OptionMarket**: Individual option markets for specific underlying assets, strikes, and expiries
- **OptionPosition**: User positions tracking quantity, Greeks, collateral, and P&L
- **OptionsPricingEngine**: Advanced pricing engine with volatility surfaces and risk models
- **AdminCap**: Administrative capabilities for system management

### Pricing & Risk Management

#### Black-Scholes Pricing
- Mathematically accurate Black-Scholes implementation
- Proper time decay calculations with square root of time
- Moneyness-based adjustments for ITM/OTM options
- Volatility scaling and risk-free rate integration

#### Greeks Calculations
- **Delta**: Rate of price change relative to underlying (0-1 for calls, 0 to -1 for puts)
- **Gamma**: Rate of delta change (highest at-the-money)
- **Theta**: Time decay (accelerates near expiry)
- **Vega**: Volatility sensitivity (highest for ATM and longer-term options)
- **Rho**: Interest rate sensitivity (positive for calls, negative for puts)

### Pyth Network Integration
- Real-time price feeds with staleness protection (60-second max age)
- **Configurable price feed IDs:** Each supported asset's Pyth price feed ID is stored in the OptionsRegistry at deployment/initialization.
- **Runtime validation:** When fetching a price, the contract checks that the provided PriceInfoObject's price ID matches the configured value in the registry, ensuring correct and secure price usage.
- Price validation with magnitude checks
- Automatic scaling and format conversion
- Asset-specific feed ID validation (no hardcoded IDs in contract logic)

### DeepBook Integration
- Balance manager validation for all trading operations
- Trade proof verification for secure fund management
- Framework for order routing and liquidity provision
- Collateral management through validated balance managers

### UNXV Tokenomics
- Five-tier staking system (1K to 500K UNXV)
- Up to 25% fee discounts for high-tier stakers
- Automatic fee collection and burning mechanisms
- Premium feature access for UNXV holders

## Deployment & Testing

### Build and Test
```bash
cd sui/unxv_options
sui move build
sui move test
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Protocol initialization
- ✅ Market creation (CALL/PUT options)
- ✅ Long position trading (buying options)
- ✅ Short position trading (selling options with collateral)
- ✅ Option exercise (manual and automatic)
- ✅ Greeks calculations verification
- ✅ UNXV discount tier system
- ✅ Emergency pause/resume functionality
- ✅ Market statistics tracking

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy to Sui testnet: `sui client publish`
2. Initialize registry with supported assets
3. Set up admin controls and emergency procedures
4. Configure Pyth price feeds for supported assets
5. Establish DeepBook pool connections

## Integration Points

### For CLI/Server
```typescript
// Option market creation
await client.moveCall({
  target: `${packageId}::unxv_options::create_option_market`,
  arguments: [registry, underlying, optionType, strike, expiry, settlementType, exerciseStyle, adminCap]
});

// Buy option (long position)
await client.moveCall({
  target: `${packageId}::unxv_options::buy_option`,
  arguments: [market, registry, pricingEngine, quantity, maxPremium, balanceManager, tradeProof, priceFeeds, clock]
});

// Exercise option
await client.moveCall({
  target: `${packageId}::unxv_options::exercise_option`,
  arguments: [position, market, registry, quantity, settlementPreference, balanceManager, tradeProof, priceFeeds, clock]
});
```

### For Frontend
- **Market Data**: Query option markets, prices, and Greeks
- **Position Management**: Display user positions and P&L
- **Risk Metrics**: Show portfolio Greeks and risk concentration
- **UNXV Benefits**: Display staking tiers and discounts

## Deployment & Initialization Checklist

To use the UnXversal Options Protocol on-chain, you must create and initialize the following shared objects after publishing the package:

### 1. **Registry**
- Create the central `OptionsRegistry` object using the provided entry function.
- **Register Pyth price feed IDs for each supported asset** using the `add_underlying_asset` entry function. This ensures the contract can validate all incoming price feeds at runtime.

### 2. **Pools**
- For each trading pair (e.g., BTC/USDC), create a DeepBook `Pool` using `create_permissionless_pool` or the appropriate entry function.
- Pools are required for all underlying assets you want to support.

### 3. **BalanceManagers**
- Each user (or trading bot) must create their own `BalanceManager` object using `BalanceManager::new`.
- This object holds user funds and is required for all trading actions.

### 4. **Other Shared Objects**
- Any other required shared objects (e.g., DeepBook Registry, AdminCaps, etc.) must also be created as needed.

### 5. **Initialization Script Example**
- After publishing the Move package, run a script or sequence of transactions to:
    - Create the `OptionsRegistry`.
    - Create all required `Pool` objects.
    - (Optionally) Create initial `BalanceManager` objects for test users.
    - Register assets and configure protocol parameters as needed.

### 6. **Passing Objects to Entry Functions**
- All protocol entry functions require you to pass in the relevant shared objects (e.g., `&mut Pool`, `&mut BalanceManager`, `&OptionsRegistry`).
- The contract does **not** assume any pre-existing global objects; you must always pass them in.
- **Price feed validation:** The contract will compare the price ID in the provided `PriceInfoObject` to the configured value in the registry for the relevant asset. If they do not match, the transaction aborts. This prevents price spoofing and ensures robust oracle integration.

---

**See the contract source for comments on each entry function specifying which objects must be passed in.**
