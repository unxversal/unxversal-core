# **Unxversal Protocol Implementation Guide**

*A comprehensive DeFi operating system on Sui with unified margin, fee capture, and governance*

---

## **Executive Summary**

Unxversal is a modular DeFi protocol on Sui that provides spot trading, synthetics, lending, derivatives, and liquid staking with unified cross-margin and fee capture. All protocol fees auto-convert to UNXV tokens, creating a sustainable value loop. The implementation spans 3 main components: on-chain smart contracts, CLI API server, and frontend GUI.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Single cross-margin account across all products
- All fees route to UNXV (buy & burn/treasury)
- Native DeepBook integration for matching
- Pyth oracle integration for 400+ assets
- Unified governance via veUNXV

# **Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-4)**

## **1.1 Core Infrastructure**

### **UNXV Token & Governance System**

**Overview:**
The UNXV token serves as the cornerstone of the entire Unxversal ecosystem, functioning as both a utility token and governance mechanism. Users can lock UNXV for 1-4 years to receive veUNXV (vote-escrowed UNXV), which grants voting power proportional to lock duration. This creates strong long-term alignment between token holders and protocol success.

**Key Features:**
- Hard-capped supply of 1 billion tokens prevents inflation
- All protocol fees auto-convert to UNXV, creating constant buy pressure
- Governance controls all protocol parameters, fee distributions, and new product launches
- veUNXV holders receive fee rebates and boosted farming yields

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. User receives UNXV tokens from:
   - Trading fee rebates
   - Liquidity provision rewards  
   - Governance participation rewards
   - Direct purchase on DEX

2. User decides to participate in governance:
   - Locks 10,000 UNXV for 4 years
   - Receives maximum veUNXV voting power
   - Can now vote on protocol proposals

3. Active governance participation:
   - Reviews weekly gauge weight proposals
   - Votes to direct UNXV emissions to preferred products
   - Creates proposal to list new synthetic asset
   - Earns fee rebates and boosted yields from participation
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
// Core token implementation
module unxversal::token {
    struct UNXV has drop {}
    struct TreasureyCap has key, store {}
    
    const TOTAL_SUPPLY: u64 = 1_000_000_000;
    const DECIMALS: u8 = 9;
}

// veUNXV governance token
module unxversal::ve_token {
    struct VeUNXV has key, store {
        id: UID,
        amount: u64,
        lock_end: u64,
        voting_power: u64
    }
    
    public fun lock(amount: u64, duration: u64): VeUNXV
    public fun vote(proposal_id: u64, vote: bool)
    public fun delegate(to: address)
}

// DAO governance
module unxversal::governance {
    struct Proposal has key, store {
        id: UID,
        proposer: address,
        targets: vector<address>,
        values: vector<u64>,
        calldatas: vector<vector<u8>>,
        start_block: u64,
        end_block: u64,
        votes_for: u64,
        votes_against: u64,
        executed: bool
    }
    
    public fun propose(...): u64
    public fun vote(proposal_id: u64, support: bool)
    public fun execute(proposal_id: u64)
}
```

**CLI API Endpoints:**
```typescript
// Token management
POST /api/v1/token/lock          // Lock UNXV for veUNXV
GET  /api/v1/token/balance       // Get token balances
GET  /api/v1/token/voting-power  // Get voting power

// Governance
POST /api/v1/governance/propose  // Create proposal
POST /api/v1/governance/vote     // Vote on proposal
GET  /api/v1/governance/proposals // List proposals
```

**Frontend Components:**
```tsx
// Core governance interface
interface GovernancePanel {
  proposals: Proposal[]
  votingPower: number
  lockedBalance: number
  actions: {
    createProposal: (data: ProposalData) => void
    vote: (proposalId: string, support: boolean) => void
    lock: (amount: number, duration: number) => void
  }
}

interface TokenDashboard {
  unxvBalance: number
  veUnxvBalance: number
  stakingRewards: number
  feeRebates: number
}
```

### **Fee Sink System**

**Overview:**
The Fee Sink System is the economic engine that powers Unxversal's value accrual mechanism. Every fee generated across all protocol components (trading, lending, minting, liquidations) is automatically collected in the original asset, then immediately swapped to UNXV via DeepBook. This creates constant buying pressure for UNXV regardless of which products users interact with.

**Key Features:**
- Universal fee collection from all protocol components
- Automatic asset-to-UNXV swapping with slippage protection
- Configurable distribution between burn, treasury, and insurance funds
- Real-time fee routing without manual intervention

**Sample Process Flow:**
```
1. User trades BTC/USDC on spot DEX:
   - Pays 6 bps fee in USDC
   - Fee automatically collected by fee sink

2. Automatic fee processing:
   - Fee sink swaps USDC to UNXV via DeepBook RFQ
   - Slippage protection ensures fair conversion rate
   - Resulting UNXV distributed per governance rules

3. UNXV distribution example (default split):
   - 50% burned (reduces total supply)
   - 30% sent to Treasury for protocol development
   - 20% allocated to insurance funds for risk coverage

4. Value accrual impact:
   - Constant UNXV buying pressure from all protocol activity
   - Deflationary mechanism through burns
   - Self-sustaining treasury funding
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::fee_sink {
    struct FeeSink has key {
        id: UID,
        treasury_rate: u64,
        burn_rate: u64,
        insurance_rate: u64
    }
    
    // Auto-swap any asset to UNXV via DeepBook
    public fun deposit<T>(fee_asset: Coin<T>, amount: u64)
    public fun swap_to_unxv<T>(asset: Coin<T>): Coin<UNXV>
    public fun distribute_unxv(unxv: Coin<UNXV>)
}

// Module-specific fee collectors
module unxversal::fee_sink_dex { ... }
module unxversal::fee_sink_perps { ... }
module unxversal::fee_sink_lend { ... }
```

### **Oracle Integration**

**Overview:**
Oracle integration provides reliable, low-latency price feeds for over 400 assets through Pyth Network, with DeepBook TWAP as a fallback mechanism. This dual-oracle approach ensures continuous price availability while maintaining security through redundancy. The oracle system powers all synthetic assets, margin calculations, funding rates, and settlement prices across the protocol.

**Key Features:**
- Primary integration with Pyth for 400+ asset price feeds
- DeepBook TWAP fallback with automatic switching
- Confidence intervals and staleness checks for price quality
- Real-time price updates with sub-second latency

**Sample Process Flow:**
```
1. Price feed request for BTC:
   - Protocol queries Pyth oracle for BTC/USD price
   - Receives price: $45,000 with 0.1% confidence interval
   - Timestamp verification: Updated 2 seconds ago (fresh)

2. Price validation:
   - Confidence interval within acceptable bounds (<1%)
   - Price age under staleness threshold (30 seconds)
   - Price approved for use across protocol

3. Fallback scenario (Pyth unavailable):
   - DeepBook TWAP calculation over 15-minute window
   - 2% haircut applied for conservative pricing
   - Temporary price used with heightened risk monitoring

4. Protocol usage:
   - Synthetic asset pricing for sBTC minting
   - Margin calculations for leveraged positions  
   - Funding rate calculations for perpetuals
   - Settlement prices for options and futures
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::oracle {
    struct PriceInfo has copy, drop {
        price: u64,
        conf: u64,
        timestamp: u64,
        expo: i32
    }
    
    public fun get_price(feed_id: vector<u8>): PriceInfo
    public fun get_price_with_fallback(feed_id: vector<u8>): PriceInfo
    public fun update_price_feeds(attestations: vector<vector<u8>>)
}
```

**CLI Integration:**
```typescript
// Oracle price feeds
GET /api/v1/oracle/prices        // Get all price feeds
GET /api/v1/oracle/price/{symbol} // Get specific price
WebSocket /ws/prices             // Real-time price stream
```

## **1.2 Spot DEX (DeepBook Integration)**

**Overview:**
The Spot DEX provides a familiar trading experience by leveraging Sui's native DeepBook orderbook infrastructure. Rather than building a custom matching engine, Unxversal wraps DeepBook with fee collection and synthetic asset support. This approach ensures deterministic execution, shared liquidity with the broader Sui ecosystem, and CEX-grade performance with decentralized transparency.

**Key Features:**
- Native DeepBook integration for deterministic order matching
- Real-time relayer mesh for sub-second order updates
- Automatic fee collection routing to UNXV flywheel
- Support for synthetic assets (sBTC, sETH, etc.) as first-class citizens
- Permissionless market creation for any Pyth-priced asset

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. User wants to trade ETH for USDC:
   - Connects wallet to Unxversal interface
   - Selects ETH/USDC trading pair
   - Views real-time orderbook with live prices

2. Market order execution:
   - User submits market buy for 5 ETH
   - Order routed to DeepBook matching engine
   - Matched against best available asks
   - Execution price: $2,485 average

3. Fee processing:
   - 6 bps taker fee charged: ~$74.50 in USDC
   - Fee automatically swapped to UNXV via DeepBook
   - 60% to relayer, 40% to protocol fee sink

4. Settlement:
   - User receives 5 ETH in wallet
   - Trade appears in history with fee breakdown
   - Real-time P&L tracking updated
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::spot_dex {
    public fun place_order<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
        pool: &mut Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
        price: u64,
        quantity: u64,
        is_bid: bool,
        client_order_id: u64
    ): (OrderInfo, Option<MatchResult>)
    
    public fun cancel_order<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
        pool: &mut Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
        order_id: u128
    )
    
    public fun market_order<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>(
        pool: &mut Pool<BaseAsset, QuoteAsset>,
        quantity: u64,
        is_bid: bool
    ): MatchResult
}
```

**CLI API:**
```typescript
// Order management
POST /api/v1/dex/order           // Place order
DELETE /api/v1/dex/order/{id}    // Cancel order
GET /api/v1/dex/orders           // Get open orders

// Market data

WebSocket /ws/orderbook          // Real-time orderbook
WebSocket /ws/trades             // Real-time trades
```

**Frontend Components:**
```tsx
interface TradingInterface {
  pair: TradingPair
  orderbook: OrderBook
  trades: Trade[]
  userOrders: Order[]
  actions: {
    placeOrder: (order: OrderRequest) => void
    cancelOrder: (orderId: string) => void
  }
}

interface OrderBook {
  bids: OrderLevel[]
  asks: OrderLevel[]
  spread: number
  midPrice: number
}
```

## **1.3 Synthetic Assets (sAssets)**

**Overview:**
Synthetic Assets (sAssets) enable users to gain exposure to any Pyth-priced asset using USDC collateral. By locking USDC at 160% collateralization ratio, users can mint synthetic versions of Bitcoin (sBTC), Ethereum (sETH), or any of 400+ supported assets. These sAssets are first-class citizens across the entire Unxversal ecosystem, tradeable on the DEX, usable as collateral for lending, and available as underlying assets for derivatives.

**Key Features:**
- Mint any Pyth-priced asset using USDC collateral
- Minimum 160% collateralization ratio for safety
- sAssets trade 1:1 with underlying asset price
- Integrated with all protocol components (lending, trading, derivatives)
- Automatic liquidation system protects protocol solvency

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. User wants exposure to Bitcoin without buying BTC:
   - Deposits 32,000 USDC as collateral (160% CR)
   - Current BTC price: $50,000
   - Can mint up to $20,000 worth of sBTC (0.4 sBTC)

2. Minting process:
   - User chooses to mint 0.3 sBTC ($15,000 exposure)
   - 15 bps mint fee: $22.50 in USDC
   - Fee automatically swapped to UNXV
   - User receives 0.3 sBTC tokens

3. Using synthetic assets:
   - Trade sBTC on spot DEX for other assets
   - Use sBTC as collateral in lending protocol
   - Open perpetual positions with sBTC as underlying
   - Write options contracts against sBTC holdings

4. Position management:
   - Monitor collateralization ratio in real-time
   - Add more USDC if ratio drops below 170%
   - Burn sBTC to reduce debt and unlock collateral
   - Automatic liquidation protection at 160% threshold
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::synth_vault {
    struct Position has key {
        id: UID,
        collateral_usdc: u64,

# **Phase 2: Financial Core (Months 5-7)**

## **2.1 Lending Protocol (uCoin)**

**Overview:**
The Lending Protocol transforms Unxversal into a comprehensive money market where users can supply assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral. Supporting USDC, UNXV, and all synthetic assets, the protocol uses dynamic interest rate models that adjust based on utilization. Idle margin from derivatives trading is automatically deposited to earn yield, maximizing capital efficiency across the entire platform.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-asset money market with algorithmic interest rates
- Cross-collateral borrowing with portfolio-based health checks
- Flash loans for arbitrage and liquidation opportunities
- Automatic idle margin deployment for yield generation
- Interest rate models that respond to market utilization

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. Supplying assets for yield:
   - User deposits 50,000 USDC to lending pool
   - Receives uUSDC tokens representing their share
   - Earns 8% APY based on current utilization (60%)
   - Interest compounds automatically every block

2. Borrowing against collateral:
   - User has 100,000 USDC supplied (80% LTV = $80K borrowing power)
   - Decides to borrow 10 sBTC worth $30,000
   - Current borrow rate: 12% APY
   - Health factor: 2.67 (well above liquidation threshold)

3. Cross-margin integration:
   - User opens perpetual futures position
   - Idle margin automatically lent out earning 6% APY
   - Position profits can be used as additional collateral
   - Unified account view shows total portfolio health

4. Flash loan example:
   - Arbitrageur spots price discrepancy
   - Flash borrows 100,000 USDC for one transaction
   - Executes arbitrage trade earning $500 profit
   - Repays loan + fee ($50) in same transaction
   - Keeps $450 profit with zero capital requirement
```

**On-Chain Components:**

```

## **2.2 Cross-Margin System**

**Overview:**
The Cross-Margin System is Unxversal's revolutionary unified account model that allows users to trade spot, perpetuals, futures, and options all from a single margin pool. Positions across different venues net against each other, dramatically improving capital efficiency. A user's sSUI staking rewards, spot holdings, and derivative profits all contribute to their total collateral value, enabling sophisticated trading strategies with minimal capital requirements.

**Key Features:**
- Single margin account for all trading activities
- Cross-product position netting for maximum capital efficiency
- Real-time portfolio risk monitoring and health scoring
- Automatic margin optimization across all positions
- Unified liquidation system protecting protocol solvency

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. Account setup and funding:
   - User deposits 100,000 USDC to cross-margin account
   - Also deposits 10 sBTC worth $500,000
   - Stakes 50,000 SUI earning yield as sSUI collateral
   - Total account value: $1,100,000

2. Complex multi-product strategy:
   - Opens long BTC perpetual: +2 BTC ($100K notional)
   - Writes covered calls: -20 BTC call options
   - Supplies excess USDC to lending for yield
   - All positions share the same margin pool

3. Risk and margin calculation:
   - Perpetual requires $5,000 maintenance margin (20x leverage)
   - Options require $15,000 collateral (covered by sBTC)
   - Net portfolio delta: effectively neutral
   - Health factor: 3.2 (well above liquidation threshold)

4. Automated capital efficiency:
   - sSUI earns staking rewards while serving as collateral
   - Lending positions earn interest on idle capital
   - Cross-margin netting reduces total margin requirements
   - Profits from one position can support others automatically
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::cross_margin {
    struct MarginAccount has key {
        id: UID,
        owner: address,
        collateral: VecMap<TypeName, u64>,
        positions: VecMap<u64, Position>,
        unrealized_pnl: i64,
        last_funding_update: u64
    }
    
    struct Position has store {
        market_id: u64,
        size: i64,        // positive = long, negative = short
        entry_price: u64,
        last_funding_index: u64
    }
    
    public fun add_collateral<T>(
        account: &mut MarginAccount,
        collateral: Coin<T>
    )
    
    public fun withdraw_collateral<T>(
        account: &mut MarginAccount,
        amount: u64
    ): Coin<T>
    
    public fun get_account_value(account: &MarginAccount): (u64, u64) // (collateral, margin_req)
    public fun is_liquidatable(account: &MarginAccount): bool
}
```

## **2.3 Perpetual Futures**

**Overview:**
Perpetual Futures provide leveraged exposure to any asset without expiration dates, using funding rates to maintain price convergence with the underlying asset. Built on DeepBook for transparent execution and integrated with the cross-margin system, users can trade with up to 20x leverage while benefiting from shared liquidity. The protocol captures funding payments and trading fees, routing them to the UNXV flywheel and insurance fund.

**Key Features:**
- Up to 20x leverage on major assets, 10x on synthetic assets
- Funding rates based on Pyth mark price vs DeepBook index price
- Cross-margin integration for capital efficiency
- DeepBook matching for transparent, deterministic execution
- Automatic funding settlements and liquidation protection

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. Opening a leveraged position:
   - User bullish on Ethereum, current price $2,500
   - Deposits $10,000 USDC as margin
   - Opens 10x long position: 40 ETH notional ($100,000)
   - Required margin: $5,000 (50% of deposit as buffer)

2. Position monitoring:
   - ETH price moves to $2,600 (+4%)
   - Position P&L: +$4,000 (40% return on margin)
   - Funding rate: -0.01% (pays long positions)
   - Hourly funding payment: -$10

3. Funding rate mechanism:
   - Perpetual trading above spot: funding rate positive
   - Long positions pay short positions
   - Protocol takes 10% of funding flows as fee
   - Rates adjust automatically based on premium/discount

4. Risk management:
   - Liquidation price: $2,250 (10% below entry)
   - Health factor continuously monitored
   - Margin auto-deposited from other cross-margin positions
   - Insurance fund provides backstop for extreme events

# **Phase 3: Derivatives (Months 8-11)**

## **3.1 Dated Futures**

**Overview:**
Dated Futures provide leveraged exposure with fixed expiration dates, offering clean settlement without the complexity of perpetual funding rates. These contracts trade on DeepBook and settle to Pyth oracle prices at expiry, making them ideal for hedging specific time horizons or capturing basis spreads. The 30-minute pre-expiry price freeze ensures manipulation-resistant settlement.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed expiration dates for precise hedging strategies
- No funding rate complexity - pay only trading fees
- 30-minute price freeze before settlement for security
- Cross-margin integration with other protocol positions
- Automatic cash settlement at expiry using Pyth prices

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. Strategic hedging scenario:
   - Crypto fund needs to hedge BTC exposure for Q4
   - Current BTC price: $45,000
   - BTC-DEC futures trading at $46,500 (3.3% premium)
   - Fund shorts 100 BTC futures to hedge portfolio

2. Position management:
   - Required margin: $450,000 (10x leverage)
   - No funding payments throughout holding period
   - Basis tracking: futures vs spot price convergence
   - Daily mark-to-market P&L updates

3. Approaching expiry:
   - 30 minutes before expiry: price freeze activated
   - Final settlement price: 30-min Pyth TWAP
   - All outstanding orders automatically cancelled
   - Position holders notified of impending settlement

4. Cash settlement:
   - Settlement price determined: $47,200
   - Short position P&L: +$70,000 (profitable hedge)
   - Automatic USDC credit to cross-margin account
   - Position closed, margin released for new trades
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::futures {
    struct FutureSeries has key {
        id: UID,
        asset_id: vector<u8>,
        expiry_timestamp: u64,
        settlement_price: Option<u64>,
        max_leverage: u64,

        settled: bool
    }
    
    public fun create_series(
        asset_id: vector<u8>,
        expiry: u64,
        max_lev: u64,
        tick: u64
    ): FutureSeries
    
    public fun settle_expiry(series: &mut FutureSeries)
    public fun trade_future(
        account: &mut MarginAccount,
        series: &FutureSeries,
        size: i64,
        price: u64
    )
}
```

## **3.2 Options Trading**

**Overview:**
Options Trading provides European-style calls and puts with full collateralization and cash settlement. Writers post collateral to mint option tokens that can be traded on DeepBook or via gas-efficient RFQ (Request for Quote) systems. Dynamic margin requirements adjust based on time to expiry and moneyness, while the cross-margin system enables capital-efficient portfolio strategies.

**Key Features:**
- European calls and puts with cash settlement
- RFQ system for illiquid strikes to save gas costs
- Dynamic collateral requirements based on Black-Scholes models
- IV caps prevent manipulation during high volatility
- Cross-margin portfolio optimization for complex strategies

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. Option writing strategy:
   - User bullish on ETH, current price $2,500
   - Writes 10 ETH call options, $3,000 strike, 30-day expiry
   - Collateral required: $8,500 (max loss calculation)
   - Receives $150 premium per contract ($1,500 total)

2. Option buying for hedging:
   - DeFi protocol holds large ETH treasury
   - Buys protective puts: $2,200 strike, 60-day expiry
   - Premium paid: $75 per contract for 100 contracts
   - Downside protection secured for treasury holdings

3. RFQ trading for illiquid strikes:
   - Market maker posts signed quote off-chain
   - $2,750 calls quoted at $45 premium
   - Buyer submits quote to on-chain RFQ module
   - Instant settlement without orderbook posting

4. Expiry and settlement:
   - Option expires with ETH at $3,200
   - Call options finish in-the-money ($200 intrinsic)
   - Automatic cash settlement: writers pay $200 per contract
   - Put options expire worthless, writers keep full premium
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::options {
    struct OptionSeries has key {
        id: UID,
        underlier: vector<u8>,
        option_type: u8, // 0 = call, 1 = put
        strike: u64,
        expiry: u64,
        iv_cap: u64,
        settled: bool
    }
    
    struct OptionPosition has store {
        series_id: u64,
        contracts: u64,
        premium_paid: u64,
        is_writer: bool
    }
    
    public fun write_option(
        account: &mut MarginAccount,
        series: &OptionSeries,
        contracts: u64,
        collateral: u64
    ): vector<OptionToken>
    
    public fun buy_option(
        series: &OptionSeries,
        contracts: u64,
        premium: Coin<USDC>
    ): vector<OptionToken>
    
    public fun exercise_option(
        series: &mut OptionSeries,
        tokens: vector<OptionToken>
    ): Coin<USDC>
}
```

## **3.3 Exotic Derivatives**

**Overview:**
Exotic Derivatives introduce path-dependent payoffs that enable sophisticated hedging and speculation strategies unavailable with vanilla options. These include barrier options (knock-in/knock-out), range accrual notes, and power perpetuals. The system tracks price paths using ring buffers and oracle feeds, enabling complex payoff calculations while maintaining the same fee capture and cross-margin benefits as other protocol components.

**Key Features:**
- Barrier options with knock-in/knock-out functionality
- Range accrual notes for volatility strategies
- Power perpetuals for convex/leveraged exposure
- Real-time path monitoring with oracle integration
- Higher fee tolerance due to specialized nature

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. Barrier option strategy:
   - User wants leveraged BTC upside but with downside protection
   - Current BTC: $45,000, barrier: $40,000
   - Buys knock-out call: $50,000 strike, barrier $40,000
   - Premium: $800 (cheaper than vanilla due to knock-out risk)

2. Range accrual investment:
   - Conservative investor wants yield in sideways markets
   - ETH range accrual: earns 2% monthly if ETH stays $2,200-$2,800
   - Current ETH: $2,500 (middle of range)
   - Invests $50,000 for 6-month product

3. Power perpetual speculation:
   - Trader believes SOL will be highly volatile
   - Opens SOL² power perp (payoff proportional to SOL²)
   - Position amplifies both upside and downside moves
   - Funding adjusts based on realized vs implied volatility

4. Path monitoring and settlement:
   - Oracle continuously updates price history
   - Barrier breach automatically triggers knock-out
   - Range accrual pays coupons when conditions met
   - All settlements route through cross-margin system
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::exotics {
    struct ExoticSeries has key {
        id: UID,
        payoff_type: u8, // KO_CALL, KI_PUT, RANGE_ACC, PWR_PERP
        underlier: vector<u8>,
        params: VecMap<vector<u8>, u64>, // strike, barrier, etc.
        expiry: u64,
        barrier_hit: bool,
        path_data: vector<u64>
    }
    
    public fun create_barrier_option(
        underlier: vector<u8>,
        strike: u64,
        barrier: u64,
        expiry: u64,
        is_call: bool,
        is_knock_out: bool
    ): ExoticSeries
    
    public fun create_power_perp(

# **Phase 4: Yield & Infrastructure (Months 12-14)**

## **4.1 Liquid Staking (sSUI)**

**Overview:**
Liquid Staking transforms locked SUI stake into sSUI, a transferable and yield-bearing token that earns native staking rewards while remaining liquid for DeFi activities. sSUI can be used as collateral across all Unxversal protocols, creating a capital-efficient way to earn both staking rewards and trading returns. The protocol captures a 5% fee on staking rewards, routing it to the UNXV flywheel.

**Key Features:**
- Tokenized SUI staking with automatic rebasing
- High LTV collateral (90%) accepted across all protocols
- Instant liquidity via DeepBook sSUI/SUI market
- Diversified validator set for security and decentralization
- Automated reward compounding with fee capture

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. Staking SUI for liquidity:
   - User holds 100,000 SUI earning no yield
   - Stakes through Unxversal protocol
   - Receives 100,000 sSUI (1:1 initial rate)
   - Maintains full liquidity while earning ~5.5% APY

2. Using sSUI in DeFi:
   - Supplies 50,000 sSUI to lending protocol
   - Uses as collateral to borrow 30,000 USDC
   - Opens leveraged positions with borrowed funds
   - Earns staking rewards + lending interest + trading profits

3. Automated yield optimization:
   - sSUI balance increases daily through rebasing
   - Original 100,000 sSUI becomes 100,015 sSUI after one day
   - No manual claiming required - rewards auto-compound
   - 5% of rewards converted to UNXV for protocol

4. Liquidity and redemption:
   - Need quick SUI access: trade sSUI/SUI on DEX (0.3% spread)
   - Want to unstake: queue withdrawal for 2-epoch delay
   - Emergency exit: use as collateral for SUI flash loan
   - All options maintain capital efficiency
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::liquid_staking {
    struct StakePool has key {
        id: UID,
        total_sui_staked: u64,
        total_ssui_supply: u64,
        exchange_rate: u64,
        validator_set: vector<address>,
        epoch_rewards: u64,

    }
    
    public fun stake_sui(
        pool: &mut StakePool,
        sui: Coin<SUI>
    ): Coin<sSUI>
    
    public fun unstake_sui(
        pool: &mut StakePool,
        ssui: Coin<sSUI>
    ): UnstakeTicket
    
    public fun claim_unstake(
        pool: &mut StakePool,
        ticket: UnstakeTicket
    ): Coin<SUI>
    
    public fun rebase(pool: &mut StakePool)
}
```

## **4.2 LP Vaults**

**Overview:**
LP Vaults democratize sophisticated market-making strategies by allowing passive users to deposit assets into automated strategies that provide liquidity across all Unxversal venues. These vaults can simultaneously market-make on spot DEX, write options, capture funding rates on perpetuals, and execute basis trades between futures and spot. Each vault implements specific strategies while sharing cross-margin benefits and fee optimization.

**Key Features:**
- Automated multi-venue market making strategies
- Cross-margin position hedging and optimization
- Professional-grade strategies accessible to retail users
- Performance and management fees supporting strategy development
- Real-time strategy performance tracking and risk monitoring

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. Choosing a vault strategy:

   - Reviews available vault strategies:
     * Delta-neutral range MM: 8-12% APY, low risk
     * Covered call writing: 15-20% APY, medium risk
     * Funding arbitrage: 12-18% APY, medium risk
   - Selects delta-neutral range strategy

2. Vault deposit and operation:
   - Deposits 100,000 USDC, receives vault tokens
   - Vault automatically deploys capital:
     * 60% provides liquidity on ETH/USDC orderbook
     * 25% writes covered calls against ETH position
     * 15% held as cash buffer for rebalancing

3. Strategy execution:
   - Vault earns bid-ask spreads from market making
   - Collects option premiums from covered calls
   - Automatically hedges delta exposure via perpetuals
   - Rebalances positions based on volatility and market conditions

4. Performance and withdrawal:
   - Monthly performance: +1.2% (14.4% annualized)
   - Performance breakdown: 8% from MM, 6.4% from options
   - User decides to withdraw 50% after 6 months
   - Receives 53,600 USDC + vault tokens worth $50,000
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::lp_vaults {
    struct Vault<phantom T> has key {
        id: UID,

    public fun harvest<T>(vault: &mut Vault<T>)
}
```

## **4.3 Gas Futures**

**Overview:**
Gas Futures represent a novel financial primitive that allows users and protocols to hedge against Sui network transaction fee volatility. Each contract represents a claim on a fixed amount of gas units (typically 1M units) at a predetermined USD price. This enables treasuries to budget their operational costs, arbitrageurs to trade gas price volatility, and the broader ecosystem to achieve more predictable cost structures.

**Key Features:**
- Tokenized claims on future gas units at fixed USD prices
- Both AMM and orderbook trading venues for price discovery
- Fully collateralized with automatic hedging for protocol safety
- Cash settlement with no physical gas delivery required
- Integration with treasury management and operational cost planning

**Sample User Process Flow:**
```
1. Treasury cost hedging:
   - DAO expects to spend $10,000 on governance proposals next quarter
   - Current SUI gas costs: $0.02 per 1,000 units
   - Buys 500 gas future contracts at $0.025 per 1,000 units
   - Locks in maximum gas costs regardless of SUI price volatility

2. Arbitrage opportunity:
   - Trader notices gas futures trading above fair value
   - SUI price rising but gas futures haven't adjusted
   - Shorts gas futures, hedges with SUI perpetual position
   - Profits from basis convergence as contracts approach expiry

3. Corporate cost management:
   - DeFi protocol processes 1,000 transactions daily
   - Needs 100M gas units monthly for operations
   - Purchases quarterly gas futures to stabilize costs
   - CFO can budget operational expenses with certainty

4. Settlement and redemption:
   - Contract expires with gas costs at $0.03 per 1,000 units
   - Treasury receives payout: (0.03 - 0.025) × 500M = $2,500
   - Alternative: redeem contracts for actual gas coins
   - Hedging strategy successful: saved 20% on gas costs
```

**On-Chain Components:**
```move
module unxversal::gas_futures {
    struct GasSeries has key {
        id: UID,
        expiry: u64,
        strike_price: u64, // USDC per 1M gas units
        units_per_contract: u64,
        total_contracts: u64,
        reserve_pool: u64,

# **Integrated Multi-Protocol Use Cases**

## **Advanced Strategy Example: The "Everything Trade"**

**Overview:**
A sophisticated user leverages multiple Unxversal protocols in a single integrated strategy, demonstrating the power of unified margin and cross-product composability.

**Complete Process Flow:**
```
1. Initial Setup:
   - User deposits 50,000 USDC + 20,000 SUI to cross-margin account
   - Stakes SUI to receive 20,000 sSUI (earning staking yield)
   - Total collateral value: ~$120,000

2. Synthetic Asset Strategy:
   - Mints 0.5 sBTC (~$22,500) using 36,000 USDC collateral (160% CR)
   - Trades sBTC for sETH on spot DEX (diversification)
   - Now holds mixed synthetic portfolio

3. Leveraged Perpetual Position:
   - Opens 5x long BTC perpetual using $50,000 notional
   - Required margin: $10,000 (covered by existing collateral)
   - Funding rate: positive (earning funding payments)

4. Options Hedging:
   - Writes covered calls against sETH holdings (monthly expiry)
   - Buys protective puts on BTC perpetual position
   - Net premium collected: $1,200

5. Yield Optimization:
   - Remaining idle margin automatically lent for 8% APY
   - sSUI continues earning staking rewards (5.5% APY)
   - LP vault allocation for excess USDC (12% APY target)

6. Risk Management:
   - Cross-margin system nets all positions
   - Health factor maintained above 2.0
   - Automatic liquidation protection across all venues
   - Real-time portfolio monitoring and alerts

7. Fee Optimization:
   - All trading fees captured and converted to UNXV
   - veUNXV holdings provide 25% fee rebates
   - Gauge voting directs emissions to preferred strategies
   - Compounding effect from multiple revenue streams
```

## **Treasury Management Use Case**

**Overview:**
A DAO uses Unxversal protocols to optimize treasury management, hedge operational costs, and generate sustainable yield.

**Process Flow:**
```
1. Treasury Allocation:
   - DAO holds 5M UNXV + 2M USDC + 100K SUI
   - Stakes SUI for liquid sSUI to maintain flexibility
   - Locks 2M UNXV for veUNXV to maximize governance influence

2. Conservative Yield Generation:
   - Supplies 1.5M USDC to lending protocol (8% APY)
   - Participates in delta-neutral LP vault (10% APY)
   - Writes covered calls on UNXV holdings (additional 5% yield)

3. Operational Cost Hedging:
   - Estimates quarterly gas costs: $50,000
   - Purchases gas futures to lock in predictable costs
   - Hedges SUI exposure through perpetual shorts

4. Strategic Governance:
   - Uses veUNXV to vote on protocol improvements
   - Directs gauge weights to support treasury strategies
   - Proposes new products that benefit ecosystem

5. Risk Management:
   - Diversified across multiple yield sources
   - Maintains liquidity for operational needs
   - Insurance coverage through protocol insurance funds
   - Regular rebalancing based on market conditions
```

## **Institutional Market Making Strategy**

**Overview:**
A professional market maker leverages Unxversal's unified infrastructure to provide liquidity across all protocol venues while maintaining delta neutrality.

**Process Flow:**
```
1. Capital Deployment:
   - Market maker deposits 10M USDC to cross-margin account
   - Allocates capital across spot, perps, options, and futures
   - Maintains inventory across 50+ trading pairs

2. Multi-Venue Market Making:
   - Provides two-sided quotes on spot DEX orderbooks
   - Makes markets in perpetual futures with dynamic skew
   - Writes options across multiple strikes and expiries
   - Arbitrages price differences between venues

3. Delta Hedging Strategy:
   - Continuously monitors net delta exposure
   - Hedges via perpetual futures and synthetic assets
   - Uses cross-margin to optimize capital efficiency
   - Maintains market-neutral book

4. Revenue Optimization:
   - Earns bid-ask spreads across all venues
   - Collects option premiums and funding payments
   - Receives maker rebates and UNXV farming rewards
   - Optimizes fee structures through veUNXV holdings

5. Risk Controls:
   - Real-time position monitoring across all products
   - Automated circuit breakers for extreme movements
   - Cross-margin system prevents position concentration
   - Insurance fund coverage for tail risks
```

## **Retail User Journey: From Simple to Sophisticated**
