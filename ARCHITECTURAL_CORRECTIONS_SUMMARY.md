## **AUTOMATED MARKET CREATION**

### **Options Markets (Daily Creation):**
```
Daily Bot â†’ creates option markets for all assets (synth + USDC + UNXV + SUI) â†’
Standard strikes (ATM Â±20%, Â±50%) â†’ Standard expiries (daily, weekly, monthly) â†’
Automatic expiration cleanup â†’ Market statistics tracking
```

### **Futures Markets (Monthly Creation):**
```
Monthly Bot â†’ creates futures contracts for all assets â†’
Standard expiries (monthly, quarterly) â†’ Settlement preparation â†’
Automatic rollover assistance â†’ Volume and OI tracking
```

## **SUMMARY OF CORRECTIONS:**

1. **Move ALL complex calculations off-chain** (Greeks, AI/ML, route optimization)
2. **Move ALL continuous monitoring off-chain** (health checks, price monitoring)
3. **Move ALL advanced order types off-chain** (stop-loss, TWAP, conditional orders)
4. **Automated market creation via off-chain bots** (like liquidation bots)
5. **Simplify on-chain objects to basic custody + execution**
6. **All analytics and performance tracking off-chain**

This corrected architecture ensures the protocols can actually be built and deployed efficiently on Sui while maintaining all the sophisticated functionality through off-chain services.
