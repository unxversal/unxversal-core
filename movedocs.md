# Foreword

This book is dedicated to Move, a smart contract language that captures the essence of safe
programming with digital assets. Move is designed around the following values:

1. **Secure by default:** Insecure languages are a serious barrier both to accessible smart contract
   development and to mainstream adoption of digital assets. The first duty of a smart contract
   language is to prevent as many potential safety issues as possible (e.g. re-entrancy, missing
   access control checks, arithmetic overflow, ...) by construction. Any changes to Move should
   preserve or enhance its existing security guarantees.

2. **Expressive by nature:** Move must enable programmers to write any smart contract they can
   imagine. But we care as much about the way it _feels_ to write Move as we do about what Move
   allows you to do - the language should be rich enough that the features needed for a task are
   available, and minimal enough that the choice is obvious. The Move toolchain should be a
   productivity enhancer and a thought partner.

3. **Intuitive for all:** Smart contracts are only one part of a useful application. Move should
   understand the broader context of its usage and design with both the smart contract developer and
   the application developer in mind. It should be easy for developers to learn how to read
   Move-managed state, build Move powered transactions, and write new Move code.

The core technical elements of Move are:

- Safe, familiar, and flexible abstractions for digital assets via programmable _objects_.
- A rich _ability_ system (inspired by linear types) that gives programmers extreme control of how
  values are created, destroyed, stored, copied, and transferred.
- A _module_ system with strong encapsulation features to enable code reuse while maintaining this
  control.
- _Dynamic fields_ for creating hierarchical relationships between objects.
- _Programmable transaction blocks_ (PTBs) to enable atomic client-side composition of Move-powered
  APIs.

Move was born in 2018 as part of Facebook's Libra project. It was publicly revealed in 2019, the
first Move-powered network launched in 2020. As of April 2024, there are numerous Move-powered
chains in production with several more in the works. Move is an embedded language with a
platform-agnostic core, which means it takes on a slightly different personality in each chain that
uses it.

Creating a new programming language and bootstrapping a community around it is an ambitious, long
term project. A language has to be an order of magnitude better than alternatives in relevant ways
to have a chance, but even then the quality of the community matters more than the technical
fundamentals. Move is a young language, but it's off to a good start in terms of both
differentiation and community. A small, but fanatical group of smart contract programmers and core
contributors united by the Move values are pushing the boundaries of what smart contracts can do,
the applications they can enable, and who can (safely) write them. If that inspires you, read on!

— Sam Blackshear, creator of Move

# Before We Begin

Move requires an environment to run and develop applications, and in this small chapter we will
cover the prerequisites for the Move language: how to set up your IDE, how to install the compiler
and what is Move 2024. If you are already familiar with these topics or have a CLI installed, you
can skip this chapter and proceed to [the next one](../your-first-move/hello-world.md).


<!-- FILE: before-we-begin/install-sui.md -->

# Install Sui

Move is a compiled language, so you need to install a compiler to be able to write and run Move
programs. The compiler is included into the Sui binary, which can be installed or downloaded using
one of the methods below.

## Installing via suiup

The best way to install Sui is by using [`suiup`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup). It provides a simple way to install binaries and to manage different versions of binaries for
different environments (e.g. `testnet` and `mainnet`).

Installation instructions for `suiup` can be found
[in the repository README](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup).

To install Sui, run the following command:

```bash
suiup install sui
```

## Download Binary

You can download the latest Sui binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases). The binary is available for macOS,
Linux and Windows. For education purposes and development, we recommend using the `mainnet` version.

## Install Using Homebrew (MacOS)

You can install Sui using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

```bash
brew install sui
```

## Install Using Chocolatey (Windows)

You can install Sui using the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) package manager for
Windows.

```bash
choco install sui
```

## Build Using Cargo (MacOS, Linux)

You can install and build Sui locally by using the Cargo package manager (requires Rust)

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git sui --branch mainnet
```

Change the branch target here to `testnet` or `devnet` if you are targeting one of those.

Make sure that your system has the latest Rust versions with the command below.

```bash
rustup update stable
```

## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting the installation process, please refer to the
[Install Sui](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) Guide.

# Move 2024

Move 2024 is the current edition of the Move language maintained by Mysten Labs. All of the examples
in this book are written in Move 2024. If you're used to the pre-2024 version of Move, refer
to the [Move 2024 Migration Guide](./../guides/2024-migration-guide.md) to learn about the changes
and improvements in the new edition.

<!-- FILE: your-first-move/hello-world.md -->

# Hello, World!

In this chapter, you will learn how to create a new package, write a simple module, compile it, and
run tests with the Move CLI. Make sure you have [installed Sui](./../before-we-begin/install-sui)
and set up your [IDE environment](./../before-we-begin/ide-support). Run the command below to test
if Sui has been installed correctly.

```bash
# It should print the client version. E.g. sui-client 1.22.0-036299745.
sui client --version
```

> Move CLI is a command-line interface for the Move language; it is built into the Sui binary and
> provides a set of commands to manage packages, compile and test code.

The structure of the chapter is as follows:

- [Create a New Package](#create-a-new-package)
- [Directory Structure](#directory-structure)
- [Compiling the Package](#compiling-the-package)
- [Running Tests](#running-tests)

## Create a New Package

To create a new program, we will use the `sui move new` command followed by the name of the
application. Our first program will be called `hello_world`.

> Note: In this and other chapters, if you see code blocks with lines starting with `$` (dollar
> sign), it means that the following command should be run in a terminal. The sign should not be
> included. It's a common way of showing commands in terminal environments.

```bash
$ sui move new hello_world
```

The `sui move` command gives access to the Move CLI - a built-in compiler, test runner and a utility
for all things Move. The `new` command followed by the name of the package will create a new package
in a new folder. In our case, the folder name is "hello_world".

We can view the contents of the folder to see that the package was created successfully.

```bash
$ ls -l hello_world
Move.toml
sources
tests
```

## Directory Structure

Move CLI will create a scaffold of the application and pre-create the directory structure and all
necessary files. Let's see what's inside.

```plaintext
hello_world
├── Move.toml
├── sources
│   └── hello_world.move
└── tests
    └── hello_world_tests.move
```

### Manifest

The `Move.toml` file, known as the [package manifest](./../concepts/manifest), contains definitions
and configuration settings for the package. It is used by the Move Compiler to manage package
metadata, fetch dependencies, and register named addresses. We will explain it in detail in the
[Concepts](./../concepts) chapter.

> By default, the package features one named address - the name of the package.

```toml
[addresses]
hello_world = "0x0"
```

### Sources

The `sources/` directory contains the source files. Move source files have _.move_ extension, and
are typically named after the module defined in the file. For example, in our case, the file name is
_hello_world.move_ and the Move CLI has already placed commented out code inside:

```move
/*
/// Module: hello_world
module hello_world::hello_world;
*/
```

> The `/*` and `*/` are the comment delimiters in Move. Everything in between is ignored by the
> compiler and can be used for documentation or notes. We explain all ways to comment the code in
> the [Basic Syntax](./../move-basics/comments).

The commented out code is a module definition, it starts with the keyword `module` followed by a
named address (or an address literal), and the module name. The module name is a unique identifier
for the module and has to be unique within the package. The module name is used to reference the
module from other modules or transactions.

<!-- And the module name has to be a valid Move identifier: alphanumeric with underscores to separate words. A common convention is to call modules (and functions) in snake_case - all lowercase, with underscores. Coding conventions are important for readability and maintainability of the code, we summarize them in the Coding Conventions section. -->

### Tests

The `tests/` directory contains package tests. The compiler excludes these files in the regular
build process but uses them in _test_ and _dev_ modes. The tests are written in Move and are marked
with the `#[test]` attribute. Tests can be grouped in a separate module (then it's usually called
_module_name_tests.move_), or inside the module they're testing.

Modules, imports, constants and functions can be annotated with `#[test_only]`. This attribute is
used to exclude modules, functions or imports from the build process. This is useful when you want
to add helpers for your tests without including them in the code that will be published on chain.

The _hello_world_tests.move_ file contains a commented out test module template:

```move
/*
#[test_only]
module hello_world::hello_world_tests;
// uncomment this line to import the module
// use hello_world::hello_world;

const ENotImplemented: u64 = 0;

#[test]
fun test_hello_world() {
    // pass
}

#[test, expected_failure(abort_code = hello_world::hello_world_tests::ENotImplemented)]
fun test_hello_world_fail() {
    abort ENotImplemented
}
*/
```

### Other Folders

Additionally, Move CLI supports the `examples/` folder. The files there are treated similarly to the
ones placed under the `tests/` folder - they're only built in the _test_ and _dev_ modes. They are
to be examples of how to use the package or how to integrate it with other packages. The most
popular use case is for documentation purposes and library packages.

## Compiling the Package

Move is a compiled language, and as such, it requires the compilation of source files into Move
Bytecode. It contains only necessary information about the module, its members, and types, and
excludes comments and some identifiers (for example, for constants).

To demonstrate these features, let's replace the contents of the _sources/hello_world.move_ file
with the following:

```move
/// The module `hello_world` under named address `hello_world`.
/// The named address is set in the `Move.toml`.
module hello_world::hello_world;

// Imports the `String` type from the Standard Library
use std::string::String;

/// Returns the "Hello, World!" as a `String`.
public fun hello_world(): String {
    b"Hello, World!".to_string()
}
```

During compilation, the code is built, but not run. A compiled package only includes functions that
can be called by other modules or in a transaction. We will explain these concepts in the
[Concepts](./../concepts) chapter. But now, let's see what happens when we run the _sui move build_.

```bash
# run from the `hello_world` folder
$ sui move build

# alternatively, if you didn't `cd` into it
$ sui move build --path hello_world
```

It should output the following message on your console.

```plaintext
UPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Bridge
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY DeepBook
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiSystem
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING hello_world
```

During the compilation, Move Compiler automatically creates a build folder where it places all
fetched and compiled dependencies as well as the bytecode for the modules of the current package.

> If you're using a versioning system, such as Git, build folder should be ignored. For example, you
> should use a `.gitignore` file and add `build` to it.

## Running Tests

Before we get to testing, we should add a test. Move Compiler supports tests written in Move and
provides the execution environment. The tests can be placed in both the source files and in the
`tests/` folder. Tests are marked with the `#[test]` attribute and are automatically discovered by
the compiler. We explain tests in depth in the [Testing](./../move-basics/testing) section.

Replace the contents of the `tests/hello_world_tests.move` with the following content:

```move
#[test_only]
module hello_world::hello_world_tests;

use hello_world::hello_world;

#[test]
fun test_hello_world() {
    assert!(hello_world::hello_world() == b"Hello, World!".to_string(), 0);
}
```

Here we import the `hello_world` module, and call its `hello_world` function to test that the output
is indeed the string "Hello, World!". Now, that we have tests in place, let's compile the package in
the test mode and run tests. Move CLI has the `test` command for this:

```bash
$ sui move test
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```plaintext
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Bridge
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY DeepBook
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiSystem
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING hello_world
Running Move unit tests
[ PASS    ] 0x0::hello_world_tests::test_hello_world
Test result: OK. Total tests: 1; passed: 1; failed: 0
```

If you're running the tests outside of the package folder, you can specify the path to the package:

```bash
$ sui move test --path hello_world
```

You can also run a single or multiple tests at once by specifying a string. All the tests names
containing the string will be run:

```bash
$ sui move test test_hello
```

## Next Steps

In this section, we explained the basics of a Move package: its structure, the manifest, the build,
and test flows. [On the next page](./hello-sui), we will write an application and see how the code
is structured and what the language can do.

## Further Reading

- [Package Manifest](./../concepts/manifest) section
- Package in [The Move Reference](./../../reference/packages)


<!-- FILE: your-first-move/hello-sui.md -->

# Hello, Sui!

In the [previous section](./hello-world) we created a new package and demonstrated the basic flow
of creating, building, and testing a Move package. In this section, we will write a simple
application that uses the storage model and can be interacted with. To do this, we will create a
simple todo list application.

## Create a New Package

Following the same flow as in [Hello, World!](./hello-world), we will create a new package called
`todo_list`.

```bash
$ sui move new todo_list
```

## Add the Code

To speed things up and focus on the application logic, we will provide the code for the todo list
application. Replace the contents of the _sources/todo_list.move_ file with the following code:

> Note: while the contents may seem overwhelming at first, we will break it down in the following
> sections. Try to focus on what's at hand right now.

```move file=packages/todo_list/sources/todo_list.move anchor=all

```

## Build the Package

To make sure that we did everything correctly, let's build the package by running the
`sui move build` command. If everything is correct, you should see the output similar to the
following:

```bash
$ sui move build
UPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Bridge
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY DeepBook
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiSystem
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING todo_list
```

If there are no errors following this output, you have successfully built the package. If there are
errors, make sure that:

- The code is copied correctly
- The file name and the package name is correct

There are not many other reasons for the code to fail at this stage. But if you are still having
issues, try looking up the structure of the package in
[this location](https://github.com/MystenLabs/move-book/tree/main/packages/todo_list).

## Set Up an Account

> If you already have an account set up, you can skip this step.

To publish and interact with the package, we need to set up an account. While developing, the best
option for doing so is to run your own
[Local Network](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/local-network). For now you
just need to run `RUST_LOG="off,sui_node=info" sui start --with-faucet --force-regenesis`. The Sui
Local Network will run on port 9000 of your machine, so make sure that the port isn’t being used by
any other application.

If you are doing it for the first time, you will need to create a new account. To do this, run the
`sui client` command, then the CLI will prompt you with multiple questions. The answers are marked
below with `>`:

```bash
$ sui client
Config file ["/path/to/home/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml"] doesn't exist, do you want to connect to a Sui Full node server [y/N]?
> y
Sui Full node server URL (Defaults to Sui Testnet if not specified) :
> http://127.0.0.1:9000
Environment alias for [http://127.0.0.1:9000] :
> localnet
Select key scheme to generate keypair (0 for ed25519, 1 for secp256k1, 2: for secp256r1):
> 0
```

After you have answered the questions, the CLI will generate a new keypair and save it to the
configuration file. You can now use this account to interact with the network.

To check that we have the account set up correctly, run the `sui client active-address` command:

```bash
$ sui client active-address
0x....
```

The command will output the address of your account, it starts with `0x` followed by 64 characters.

## Requesting Coins

In _devnet_ and _testnet_ environments, the CLI provides a way to request coins to your account, so
you can interact with the network. To request coins, run the `sui client faucet` command:

```bash
$ sui client faucet
Request successful. It can take up to 1 minute to get the coin. Run sui client gas to check your gas coins.
```

After waiting a little bit, you can check that the Coin object was sent to your account by running
the `sui client balance` command:

```bash
$ sui client balance
╭────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Balance of coins owned by this address │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ╭──────────────────────────────────╮   │
│ │ coin  balance (raw)  balance     │   │
│ ├──────────────────────────────────┤   │
│ │ Sui   1000000000    1.00 SUI     │   │
│ ╰──────────────────────────────────╯   │
╰────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Alternatively, you can query _objects_ owned by your account, by running the `sui client objects`
command. The actual output will be different, because the object ID is unique, and so is digest, but
the structure will be similar:

```bash
$ sui client objects
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ╭────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │
│ │ objectId   │  0x4ea1303e4f5e2f65fc3709bc0fb70a3035fdd2d53dbcff33e026a50a742ce0de  │ │
│ │ version    │  4                                                                   │ │
│ │ digest     │  nA68oa8gab/CdIRw+240wze8u0P+sRe4vcisbENcR4U=                        │ │
│ │ objectType │  0x0000..0002::coin::Coin                                            │ │
│ ╰────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Now that we have the account set up and the coins in the account, we can interact with the network.
We will start by publishing the package to the network.

## Publish

To publish the package to the network, we will use the `sui client publish` command. The command
will automatically build the package and use its bytecode to publish in a single transaction.

> We are using the `--gas-budget` argument during publishing. It specifies how much gas we are
> willing to spend on the transaction. We won't touch on this topic in this section, but it's
> important to know that every transaction in Sui costs gas, and the gas is paid in SUI coins.
> It is worth noting that `--gas-budget` is not a required parameter. When you do not set it,
> there will be a default consumption limit.

The `gas-budget` is specified in _MISTs_. 1 SUI equals 10^9 MISTs. For the sake of demonstration, we
will use 100,000,000 MISTs, which is 0.1 SUI.

```bash
# run this from the `todo_list` folder
$ sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000

# alternatively, you can specify path to the package
$ sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 todo_list
```

The output of the publish command is rather lengthy, so we will show and explain it in parts.

```bash
$ sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
UPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Bridge
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY DeepBook
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiSystem
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING todo_list
Successfully verified dependencies on-chain against source.
Transaction Digest: GpcDV6JjjGQMRwHpEz582qsd5MpCYgSwrDAq1JXcpFjW
```

As you can see, when we run the `publish` command, the CLI first builds the package, then verifies
the dependencies on-chain, and finally publishes the package. The output of the command is the
transaction digest, which is a unique identifier of the transaction and can be used to query the
transaction status.

### Transaction Data

The section titled `TransactionData` contains the information about the transaction we just sent. It
features fields like `sender`, which is your address, the `gas_budget` set with the `--gas-budget`
argument, and the Coin we used for payment. It also prints the Commands that were run by the CLI. In
this example, the commands `Publish` and `TransferObject` were run - the latter transfers a special
object `UpgradeCap` to the sender.

### Events

If there were any _events_ emitted, you would see them in this section. Our package does not use
events, so the section is empty.

```

### Object Changes

These are the changes to _objects_ that transaction has made. In our case, we have _created_ a new
`UpgradeCap` object which is a special object that allows the sender to upgrade the package in the
future, _mutated_ the Gas object, and _published_ a new package. Packages are also objects on Sui.

### Balance Changes

This last section contains changes to SUI Coins, in our case, we have _spent_ around 0.015 SUI,
which in MIST is 10,500,000. You can see it under the _amount_ field in the output.

### Alternative Output

It is possible to specify the `--json` flag during publishing to get the output in JSON format. This
is useful if you want to parse the output programmatically or store it for later use.

```bash
$ sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 --json
```

### Using the Results

After the package is published on chain, we can interact with it. To do this, we need to find the
address (object ID) of the package. It's under the `Published Objects` section of the
`Object Changes` output. The address is unique for each package, so you will need to copy it from
the output.

In this example, the address is:

```plaintext
0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe
```

Now that we have the address, we can interact with the package. In the next section, we will show
how to interact with the package by sending transactions.

## Sending Transactions

To demonstrate the interaction with the `todo_list` package, we will send a transaction to create a
new list and add an item to it. Transactions are sent via the `sui client ptb` command, it allows
using the [Transaction Blocks](./../concepts/what-is-a-transaction) at full capacity. The command
may look big and complex, but we go through it step by step.

### Prepare the Variables

Before we construct the command, let's store the values we will use in the transaction. Replace the
`0x4....` with the address of the package you have published. And `MY_ADDRESS` variable will be
automatically set to your address from the CLI output.

```bash
$ export PACKAGE_ID=0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe
$ export MY_ADDRESS=$(sui client active-address)
```

### Building the Transaction in CLI

Now to building an actual transaction. The transaction will consist of two parts: we will call the
`new` function in the `todo_list` package to create a new list, and then we will transfer the list
object to our account. The transaction will look like this:

```bash
$ sui client ptb \
--gas-budget 100000000 \
--assign sender @$MY_ADDRESS \
--move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::new \
--assign list \
--transfer-objects "[list]" sender
```

In this command, we are using the `ptb` subcommand to build a transaction. Parameters that follow it
define the actual commands and actions that the transaction will perform. The first two calls we
make are utility calls to set the sender address to the command inputs and set the gas budget for
the transaction.

```bash
# sets the gas budget for the transaction
--gas-budget 100000000 \n
# registers a variable "sender=@..."
--assign sender @$MY_ADDRESS \n
```

Then we perform the actual call to a function in the package. We use the `--move-call` followed by
the package ID, the module name, and the function name. In this case, we are calling the `new`
function in the `todo_list` package.

```bash
# calls the "new" function in the "todo_list" package under the $PACKAGE_ID address
--move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::new
```

The function that we defined actually returns a value, which we want need to store. We use the
`--assign` command to give a name to the returned value. In this case, we are calling it `list`. And
then we transfer the object to our account.

```bash
--move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::new \
# assigns the result of the "new" function to the "list" variable (from the previous step)
--assign list \
# transfers the object to the sender
--transfer-objects "[list]" sender
```

Once the command is constructed, you can run it in the terminal. If everything is correct, you
should see the output similar to the one we had in previous sections. The output will contain the
transaction digest, the transaction data, and the transaction effects.

The section that we want to focus on is the "Object Changes". More specifically, the "Created
Objects" part of it. It contains the object ID, the type and the version of the `TodoList` that you
have created. We will use this object ID to interact with the list.

```

In this example the object ID is
`0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553`. And the owner should be your
account address. We achieved this by transferring the object to the sender in the last command of
the transaction.

Another way to test that you have successfully created the list is to check the account objects.

```bash
$ sui client objects
```

It should have an object that looks similar to this:

│ ╰────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │
|  ...                                                                                  |
```

### Passing Objects to Functions

The TodoList that we created in the previous step is an object that you can interact with as its
owner. You can call functions defined in the `todo_list` module on this object. To demonstrate this,
we will add an item to the list. First, we will add just one item, and in the second transaction we
will add 3 and remove another one.

Double check that you have variables set up [from the previous step](#prepare-the-variables), and
then add one more variable for the list object.

```bash
$ export LIST_ID=0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553
```

Now we can construct the transaction to add an item to the list. The command will look like this:

```bash
$ sui client ptb \
--gas-budget 100000000 \
--move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::add @$LIST_ID "'Finish the Hello, Sui chapter'"
```

In this command, we are calling the `add` function in the `todo_list` package. The function takes
two arguments: the list object and the item to add. The item is a string, so we need to wrap it in
single quotes. The command will add the item to the list.

If everything is correct, you should see the output similar to the one we had in previous sections.
Now you can check the list object to see if the item was added.

```bash
$ sui client object $LIST_ID
```

The output should contain the item that you have added.

A JSON representation of the object can be obtained by adding the `--json` flag to the command.

```bash
$ sui client object $LIST_ID --json
```

```json
{
  "objectId": "0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553",

      },
      "items": ["Finish the Hello, Sui chapter"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Chaining Commands

You can chain multiple commands in a single transaction. This shows the power of Transaction Blocks!
Using the same list object, we will add three more items and remove one. The command will look like
this:

```bash
$ sui client ptb \
--gas-budget 100000000 \
--move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::add @$LIST_ID "'Finish Concepts chapter'" \
--move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::add @$LIST_ID "'Read the Move Basics chapter'" \
--move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::add @$LIST_ID "'Learn about Object Model'" \
--move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::remove @$LIST_ID 0
```

If previous commands were successful, this one should not be any different. You can check the list
object to see if the items were added and removed. The JSON representation is a bit more readable!

```bash
sui client object $LIST_ID --json
```

```json
{
  "objectId": "0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553",

    "type": "0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe::todo_list::TodoList",
    "hasPublicTransfer": true,
    "fields": {
      "id": {
        "id": "0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553"
      },
      "items": [
        "Finish Concepts chapter",
        "Read the Move Basics chapter",
        "Learn about Object Model"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Commands don't have to be in the same package or operate on the same object. Within a single
transaction block, you can interact with multiple packages and objects. This is a powerful feature
that allows you to build complex interactions on-chain!

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have shown how to publish a package on the Move blockchain and interact with it
using the Sui CLI. We have demonstrated how to create a new list object, add items to it, and remove
them. We have also shown how to chain multiple commands in a single transaction block. This guide
should give you a good starting point for building your own applications on the Sui blockchain!


<!-- FILE: concepts/index.md -->

# Concepts

In this chapter you will learn about the basic concepts of Sui and Move. You will learn what is a
package, how to interact with it, what is an account and a transaction, and how data is stored on
Sui. While this chapter is not a complete reference, and you should refer to the
[Sui Documentation](https://docs.sui.io) for that, it will give you a good understanding of the
basic concepts required to write Move programs on Sui.


<!-- FILE: concepts/packages.md -->

# Package

<!--

    - packages and how they're stored
        - overview of packages and their contents (use a diagram)
        - how a package is created, and what it consists of
        - what is the package manifest
        - describe how "name" field is used
        - mention the "edition" field
        - what are the folders in a package and what are they for
        - how packages are imported (give Sui as an example)
        - what are addresses, and how they identify packages
        - how packages are published
        - leave a note that packages are also *upgradable*

-->

Move is a language for writing smart contracts - programs that are stored and run on the blockchain.
A single program is organized into a package. A package is published on the blockchain and is
identified by an [address](./address). A published package can be interacted with by sending
[transactions](./what-is-a-transaction) calling its functions. It can also act as a dependency for
other packages.

> To create a new package, use the `sui move new` command. To learn more about the command, run
> `sui move new --help`.

Package consists of modules - separate scopes that contain functions, types, and other items.

```
package 0x...
    module a
        struct A1
        fun hello_world()
    module b
        struct B1
        fun hello_package()
```

## Package Structure

Locally, a package is a directory with a `Move.toml` file and a `sources` directory. The `Move.toml`
file - called the "package manifest" - contains metadata about the package, and the `sources`
directory contains the source code for the modules. Package usually looks like this:

```
sources/
    my_module.move
    another_module.move
    ...
tests/
    ...
examples/
    using_my_module.move
Move.toml
```

The `tests` directory is optional and contains tests for the package. Code placed into the `tests`
directory is not published on-chain and is only available in tests. The `examples` directory can be
used for code examples, and is also not published on-chain.

## Published Package

During development, package doesn't have an address and it needs to be set to `0x0`. Once a package
is published, it gets a single unique [address](./address) on the blockchain containing its modules'
bytecode. A published package becomes _immutable_ and can be interacted with by sending
transactions.

```
0x...
    my_module: <bytecode>
    another_module: <bytecode>
```

<!-- FILE: concepts/manifest.md -->

# Package Manifest

The `Move.toml` is a manifest file that describes the [package](./packages) and its dependencies.
It is written in [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) format and contains multiple sections, the most
important of which are `[package]`, `[dependencies]` and `[addresses]`.

```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.0.0"
edition = "2024"

[dependencies]
Example = { git = "https://github.com/example/example.git", subdir = "path/to/package", rev = "framework/testnet" }

[addresses]
std =  "0x1"
alice = "0xA11CE"

[dev-addresses]
alice = "0xB0B"
```

## Sections

### Package

The `[package]` section is used to describe the package. None of the fields in this section are
published on chain, but they are used in tooling and release management; they also specify the Move
edition for the compiler.

- `name` - the name of the package when it is imported;
- `version` - the version of the package, can be used in release management;
- `edition` - the edition of the Move language; currently, the only valid value is `2024`.

<!-- published-at -->

### Dependencies

The `[dependencies]` section is used to specify the dependencies of the project. Each dependency is
specified as a key-value pair, where the key is the name of the dependency, and the value is the
dependency specification. The dependency specification can be a git repository URL or a path to the
local directory.

```toml
# git repository
Example = { git = "https://github.com/example/example.git", subdir = "path/to/package", rev = "framework/testnet" }

# local directory
MyPackage = { local = "../my-package" }
```

Packages also import addresses from other packages. For example, the Sui dependency adds the `std`
and `sui` addresses to the project. These addresses can be used in the code as aliases for the
addresses.

Starting with version 1.45 of the Sui CLI, the Sui system packages (`std`, `sui`, `system`,
`bridge`, and `deepbook`) are automatically added as dependencies if none of them are explicitly
listed.

### Resolving Version Conflicts with Override

Sometimes dependencies have conflicting versions of the same package. For example, if you have two
dependencies that use different versions of the Example package, you can override the dependency in
the `[dependencies]` section. To do so, add the `override` field to the dependency. The version of
the dependency specified in the `[dependencies]` section will be used instead of the one specified
in the dependency itself.

```toml
[dependencies]
Example = { override = true, git = "https://github.com/example/example.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }
```

### Dev-dependencies

It is possible to add `[dev-dependencies]` section to the manifest. It is used to override
dependencies in the dev and test modes. For example, if you want to use a different version of the
Sui package in the dev mode, you can add a custom dependency specification to the
`[dev-dependencies]` section.

### Addresses

The `[addresses]` section is used to add aliases for the addresses. Any address can be specified in
this section, and then used in the code as an alias. For example, if you add `alice = "0xA11CE"` to
this section, you can use `alice` as `0xA11CE` in the code.

### Dev-addresses

The `[dev-addresses]` section is the same as `[addresses]`, but only works for the test and dev
modes. Important to note that it is impossible to introduce new aliases in this section, only
override the existing ones. So in the example above, if you add `alice = "0xB0B"` to this section,
the `alice` address will be `0xB0B` in the test and dev modes, and `0xA11CE` in the regular build.

## TOML Styles

The TOML format supports two styles for tables: inline and multiline. The examples above are using
the inline style, but it is also possible to use the multiline style. You wouldn't want to use it
for the `[package]` section, but it can be useful for the dependencies.

```toml
# Inline style
[dependencies]
Example = { override = true, git = "https://github.com/example/example.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }
MyPackage = { local = "../my-package" }
```

```toml
# Multiline style
[dependencies.Example]
override = true
git = "https://github.com/example/example.git"
subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework"
rev = "framework/testnet"

[dependencies.MyPackage]
local = "../my-package"
```

# Address

<!--

Chapter: Concepts
Goal: explain locations and addresses
Notes:
    - don't talk about the type
    - packages, accounts and objects are identified by addresses
    - addresses are 32 bytes long
    - addresses are unique
    - represented as hex strings (64 characters) prefixed with 0x
    - addresses are case insensitive

Links:
    - address type


- mention what an address is, because it identifies a package
    - address is used for packages, objects, and accounts
    - address is a 32-byte value
    - address is written in hexadecimal notation
    - don't describe the type yet
    - focus on the concept of address on blockchain and on Sui in particular

 -->

Address is a unique identifier of a location on the blockchain. It is used to identify
[packages](./packages), [accounts](./what-is-an-account), and [objects](./../object/object-model).
Address has a fixed size of 32 bytes and is usually represented as a hexadecimal string prefixed
with `0x`. Addresses are case insensitive.

```move
0xe51ff5cd221a81c3d6e22b9e670ddf99004d71de4f769b0312b68c7c4872e2f1
```

The address above is an example of a valid address. It is 64 characters long (32 bytes) and prefixed
with `0x`.

Sui also has reserved addresses that are used to identify standard packages and objects. Reserved
addresses are typically simple values that are easy to remember and type. For example, the address
of the Standard Library is `0x1`. Addresses, shorter than 32 bytes, are padded with zeros to the
left.

```move
0x1 = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

Here are some examples of reserved addresses:

- `0x1` - address of the Sui Standard Library (alias `std`)
- `0x2` - address of the Sui Framework (alias `sui`)
- `0x6` - address of the system `Clock` object

> You can find all reserved addresses in the [Appendix B](../appendix/reserved-addresses).

# Account

<!--

- user is an account
    - account is identified by an address
    - account is generated from a private key
    - account can own objects
    - account can send transactions
    - every transaction has a sender
    - sender is identified by an address
    - sui cryptographic agility
    - sui account types
    - supported curves: ed25519, secp256k1, zklogin

 -->

An account is a way to identify a user. An account is generated from a private key, and is
identified by an address. An account can own objects, and can send transactions. Every transaction
has a sender, and the sender is identified by an [address](./address).

Sui supports multiple cryptographic algorithms for account generation. The two supported curves are
ed25519, secp256k1, and there is also a special way of generating an account - zklogin. The
cryptographic agility - the unique feature of Sui - allows for flexibility in the account
generation.

# Transaction

Transaction is a fundamental concept in the blockchain world. It is a way to interact with a
blockchain. Transactions are used to change the state of the blockchain, and they are the only way
to do so. In Move, transactions are used to call functions in a package, deploy new packages, and
upgrade existing ones.

<!--

- how user interacts with a program
    - mention public functions
    - give a concept of an entry / public function without getting into details
    - mention that functions are called in transactions
    - mention that transactions are sent by accounts
    - every transaction specifies object it operates on

 -->

## Transaction Structure

> Every transaction explicitly specifies the objects it operates on!

Transactions consist of:

- a sender - the [account](./what-is-an-account) that _signs_ the transaction;
- a list (or a chain) of commands - the operations to be executed;
- command inputs - the arguments for the commands: either `pure` - simple values like numbers or
  strings, or `object` - objects that the transaction will access;
- a gas object - the `Coin` object used to pay for the transaction;
- gas price and budget - the cost of the transaction;

## Inputs

Transaction inputs are the arguments for the transaction and are split between 2 types:

- Pure arguments: These are mostly [primitive types](../move-basics/primitive-types) with some extra
  additions. A pure argument can be: - [`bool`](../move-basics/primitive-types#booleans). -
  [unsigned integer](../move-basics/primitive-types#integer-types) (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`,
  `u128`, `u256`). - [`address`](../move-basics/address). -
  [`std::string::String`](../move-basics/string), UTF8 strings. -
  [`std::ascii::String`](../move-basics/string#ascii-strings), ASCII strings. -
  [`vector<T>`](../move-basics/vector), where `T` is a pure type. -
  [`std::option::Option<T>`](../move-basics/option), where `T` is a pure type. -
  [`std::object::ID`](../storage/uid-and-id), typically points to an object. See also
  [What is an Object](../object/object-model).
- Object arguments: These are objects or references of objects that the transaction will access. An
  object argument needs to be either a shared object, a frozen object, or an object that the
  transaction sender owns for the transaction to be successful. For more see
  [Object Model](../object).

## Commands

Sui transactions may consist of multiple commands. Each command is a single built-in command (like
publishing a package) or a call to a function in an already published package. The commands are
executed in the order they are listed in the transaction, and they can use the results of the
previous commands, forming a chain. Transaction either succeeds or fails as a whole.

Schematically, a transaction looks like this (in pseudo-code):

```
Inputs:
- sender = 0xa11ce

Commands:
- payment = SplitCoins(Gas, [ 1000 ])
- item = MoveCall(0xAAA::market::purchase, [ payment ])
- TransferObjects(item, sender)
```

In this example, the transaction consists of three commands:

1. `SplitCoins` - a built-in command that splits a new coin from the passed object, in this case,
   the `Gas` object;
2. `MoveCall` - a command that calls a function `purchase` in a package `0xAAA`, module `market`
   with the given arguments - the `payment` object;
3. `TransferObjects` - a built-in command that transfers the object to the recipient.

<!--
> There are multiple different implementations of transaction building, for example
-->

## Transaction Effects

Transaction effects are the changes that a transaction makes to the blockchain state. More
specifically, a transaction can change the state in the following ways:

- use the gas object to pay for the transaction;
- create, update, or delete objects;
- emit events;

The result of the executed transaction consists of different parts:

- Transaction Digest - the hash of the transaction which is used to identify the transaction;
- Transaction Data - the inputs, commands and gas object used in the transaction;
- Transaction Effects - the status and the "effects" of the transaction, more specifically: the
  status of the transaction, updates to objects and their new versions, the gas object used, the gas
  cost of the transaction, and the events emitted by the transaction;
- Events - the custom [events](./../programmability/events) emitted by the transaction;
- Object Changes - the changes made to the objects, including the _change of ownership_;
- Balance Changes - the changes made to the aggregate balances of the account involved in the
  transaction;

# Move Basics

This chapter is all about the basic syntax of the Move language. It covers the basics of the
language, such as types, modules, functions, and control flow. It focuses on the language without a
storage model or a blockchain, and explains the essential concepts of the language. To learn
features specific to Sui, such as storage functions and abilities, refer to the
[Using Objects](./../storage/) chapter, however, it is recommended to start with this chapter first.

<!-- TODO: cross link with Reference -->


<!-- FILE: move-basics/module.md -->

# Module

<!--

Chapter: Base Syntax
Goal: Introduce module keyword.
Notes:
    - modules are the base unit of code organization
    - module members are private by default
    - types internal to the module have special access rules
    - only module can pack and unpack its types

 -->

A module is the base unit of code organization in Move. Modules are used to group and isolate code,
and all members of the module are private to the module by default. In this section you will learn
how to define a module, declare its members, and access it from other modules.

## Module Declaration

Modules are declared using the `module` keyword followed by the package address, module name,
semicolon, and the module body. The module name should be in `snake_case` - all lowercase letters
with underscores between words. Modules names must be unique in the package.

Usually, a single file in the `sources/` folder contains a single module. The file name should match
the module name - for example, a `donut_shop` module should be stored in the `donut_shop.move` file.
You can read more about coding conventions in the
[Coding Conventions](./../guides/code-quality-checklist) section.

> If you need to declare more than one module in a file, you must use [Module Block](#module-block)
> syntax.

Structs, functions, constants and imports all part of the module:

- [Structs](./struct)
- [Functions](./function)
- [Constants](./constants)
- [Imports](./importing-modules)
- [Struct Methods](./struct-methods)

## Address and Named Address

The module address can be specified as both: an address _literal_ (does not require the `@` prefix)
or a named address specified in the [Package Manifest](./../concepts/manifest). In the example
below, both are identical because there's a `book = "0x0"` record in the `[addresses]` section of
the `Move.toml`.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/module.move anchor=address_literal

```

Addresses section in the Move.toml:

```toml
# Move.toml
[addresses]
book = "0x0"
```

## Module Members

Module members are declared inside the module body. To illustrate that, let's define a simple module
with a struct, a function and a constant:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/module-members.move anchor=members

```

## Module Block

The pre-2024 edition of Move required the body of the module to be a _module block_ - the contents
of the module needed to be surrounded by curly braces `{}`. The main reason to use block syntax and
not _label_ syntax is if you need to define more than one module in a file. However, using module
blocks is not recommended practice.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/module.move anchor=members

```

# Comments

<!--

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Introduce comments.
Notes:
    - doc comments are used in docgen
    - only public members are documented
    - doc comments are placed in between attributes and the definition
    - doc comments are allowed for: modules, structs, functions, constants
    - give an example of how doc comments are translated
 -->

Comments are a way to add notes or document your code. They are ignored by the compiler and don't
result in Move bytecode. You can use comments to explain what your code does, add notes to yourself
or other developers, temporarily remove a part of your code, or generate documentation. There are
three types of comments in Move: line comments, block comments, and doc comments.

## Line Comment

You can use a double slash `//` to comment out the rest of the line. Everything after `//` will be
ignored by the compiler.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/comments-line.move anchor=main

```

## Block Comment

Block comments are used to comment out a block of code. They start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
Everything between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by the compiler. You can use block comments to
comment out a single line or multiple lines. You can even use them to comment out a part of a line.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/comments-block.move anchor=main

```

This example is a bit extreme, but it shows all the ways that you can use block comments.

## Doc Comment

Documentation comments are special comments that are used to generate documentation for your code.
They are similar to block comments but start with three slashes `///` and are placed before the
definition of the item they document.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/comments-doc.move anchor=main

```

## Whitespace

Unlike some languages, whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newlines) have no impact on the meaning of the
program.

<!-- TODO: docgen, which members are in the documentation -->


<!-- FILE: move-basics/primitive-types.md -->

# Primitive Types

<!-- TODO: Shall we split this into two pages? Maybe give an overview and focus more on specifics? -->

For simple values, Move has a number of built-in primitive types. They're the foundation for all
other types. The primitive types are:

- [Booleans](#booleans)
- [Unsigned Integers](#integer-types)
- [Addresses](./address) - covered in the next section

Before we get to the primitive types, let's first take a look at how to declare and assign variables
in Move.

## Variables and Assignment

Variables are declared using the `let` keyword. They are immutable by default, but can be made
mutable by adding the `mut` keyword:

```
let <variable_name>[: <type>]  = <expression>;
let mut <variable_name>[: <type>] = <expression>;
```

Where:

- `<variable_name>` - the name of the variable
- `<type>` - the type of the variable, optional
- `<expression>` - the value to be assigned to the variable

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/primitive-types.move anchor=variables_and_assignment

```

A mutable variable can be reassigned using the `=` operator.

```move
y = 43;
```

Variables can also be shadowed by re-declaring them.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/primitive-types.move anchor=shadowing

```

## Booleans

The `bool` type represents a boolean value - yes or no, true or false. It has two possible values:
`true` and `false`, which are keywords in Move. For booleans, the compiler can always infer the type
from the value, so there is no need to explicitly specify it.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/primitive-types.move anchor=boolean

```

Booleans are often used to store flags and to control the flow of the program. Please refer to the
[Control Flow](./control-flow) section for more information.

## Integer Types

Move supports unsigned integers of various sizes, from 8-bit to 256-bit. The integer types are:

- `u8` - 8-bit
- `u16` - 16-bit
- `u32` - 32-bit
- `u64` - 64-bit
- `u128` - 128-bit
- `u256` - 256-bit

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/primitive-types.move anchor=integers

```

While boolean literals like `true` and `false` are clearly booleans, an integer literal like `42`
could be any of the integer types. In most of the cases, the compiler will infer the type from the
value, usually defaulting to `u64`. However, sometimes the compiler is unable to infer the type and
will require an explicit type annotation. It can either be provided during assignment or by using a
type suffix.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/primitive-types.move anchor=integer_explicit_type

```

### Operations

Move supports the standard arithmetic operations for integers: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder). The syntax for these operations is:

| Syntax | Operation           | Aborts If                                |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| +      | addition            | Result is too large for the integer type |
| -      | subtraction         | Result is less than zero                 |
| \*     | multiplication      | Result is too large for the integer type |
| %      | modulus (remainder) | The divisor is 0                         |
| /      | truncating division | The divisor is 0                         |

> For more operations, including bitwise operations, please refer to the
> [Move Reference](./../../reference/primitive-types/integers#bitwise).

The types of the operands _must match_, or the compiler will raise an error. The result of the
operation will be of the same type as the operands. To perform operations on different types, the
operands need to be cast to the same type.

<!-- TODO: add examples + parentheses for arithmetic operations -->
<!-- TODO: add bitwise operators -->

### Casting with `as`

Move supports explicit casting between integer types. The syntax is as follows:

```move
<expression> as <type>
```

Note that parentheses around the expression may be required to prevent ambiguity:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/primitive-types.move anchor=cast_as

```

A more complex example, preventing overflow:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/primitive-types.move anchor=overflow

```

### Overflow

Move does not support overflow / underflow; an operation that results in a value outside the range
of the type will raise a runtime error. This is a safety feature to prevent unexpected behavior.

```move
let x = 255u8;
let y = 1u8;

// This will raise an error
let z = x + y;
```

# Address Type

<!--

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Introduce the address type
Notes:
    - a special type
    - named addresses via the Move.toml
    - address literals
    - 0x2 is 0x0000000...02

Links:
    - address concept
    - transaction context
    - Move.toml
    - your first move

 -->

Move uses a special type called [address](./../concepts/address) to represent addresses. It is a
32-byte value that can represent any address on the blockchain. Addresses can be written in two
forms: hexadecimal addresses prefixed with 0x and named addresses.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/address.move anchor=address_literal

```

An address literal starts with the `@` symbol followed by a hexadecimal number or an identifier. The
hexadecimal number is interpreted as a 32 byte value. The identifier is looked up in the
[Move.toml](./../concepts/manifest) file and replaced with the corresponding address by the
compiler. If the identifier is not found in the Move.toml file, the compiler will throw an error.

## Conversion

Sui Framework offers a set of helper functions to work with addresses. Given that the address type
is a 32 byte value, it can be converted to a `u256` type and vice versa. It can also be converted to
and from a `vector<u8>` type.

Example: Convert an address to a `u256` type and back.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/address.move anchor=to_u256

```

Example: Convert an address to a `vector<u8>` type and back.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/address.move anchor=to_bytes

```

Example: Convert an address into a string.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/address.move anchor=to_string

```

<!-- FILE: move-basics/expression.md -->

# Expression

In programming languages, an expression is a unit of code that returns a value. In Move, almost
everything is an expression, with the sole exception of the `let` statement, which is a declaration.
In this section, we cover the types of expressions and introduce the concept of scope.

> Expressions are sequenced with semicolons `;`. If there's "no expression" after the semicolon, the
> compiler will insert a `unit ()`, which represents an empty expression.

## Literals

In the [Primitive types](./primitive-types) section, we introduced the basic types of Move. And to
illustrate them, we used literals. A literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source
code. Literals can be used to initialize variables or directly pass fixed values as arguments to
functions. Move has the following literals:

- Boolean values: `true` and `false`
- Integer values: `0`, `1`, `123123`
- Hexadecimal values: Numbers prefixed with 0x to represent integers, such as `0x0`, `0x1`, `0x123`
- Byte vector values: Prefixed with `b`, such as `b"bytes_vector"`
- Byte values: Hexadecimal literals prefixed with `x`, such as `x"0A"`

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/expression.move anchor=literals

```

## Operators

Arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operators are used to perform operations on values. Since these
operations produce values, they are considered expressions.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/expression.move anchor=operators

```

## Blocks

A block is a sequence of statements and expressions enclosed in curly braces `{}`. It returns the
value of the last expression in the block (note that this final expression must not have an ending
semicolon). A block is an expression, so it can be used anywhere an expression is expected.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/expression.move anchor=block

```

## Function Calls

We go into detail about functions in the [Functions](./function) section. However, we have already
used function calls in previous sections, so it's worth mentioning them here. A function call is an
expression that calls a function and returns the value of the last expression in the function body,
provided the last expression does not have a terminating semi-colon.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/expression.move anchor=fun_call

```

## Control Flow Expressions

Control flow expressions are used to control the flow of the program. They are also expressions, so
they return a value. We cover control flow expressions in the [Control Flow](./control-flow)
section. Here's a very brief overview:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/expression.move anchor=control_flow

```


<!-- FILE: move-basics/struct.md -->

# Custom Types with Struct

Move's type system shines when it comes to defining custom types. User defined types can be custom
tailored to the specific needs of the application, not only on the data level, but also in its
behavior. In this section we introduce the struct definition and how to use it.

## Struct

To define a custom type, you can use the `struct` keyword followed by the name of the type. After
the name, you can define the fields of the struct. Each field is defined with the
`field_name: field_type` syntax. Field definitions must be separated by commas. The fields can be of
any type, including other structs.

> Move does not support recursive structs, meaning a struct cannot contain itself as a field.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/struct.move anchor=def

```

In the example above, we define a `Record` struct with five fields. The `title` field is of type
`String`, the `artist` field is of type `Artist`, the `year` field is of type `u16`, the `is_debut`
field is of type `bool`, and the `edition` field is of type `Option<u16>`. The `edition` field is of
type `Option<u16>` to represent that the edition is optional.

Structs are private by default, meaning they cannot be imported and used outside of the module they
are defined in. Their fields are also private and can't be accessed from outside the module. See
[visibility](./visibility) for more information on different visibility modifiers.

> Fields of a struct are private and can only be accessed by the module defining the struct. Reading
> and writing the fields of a struct in other modules is only possible if the module defining the
> struct provides public functions to access the fields.

## Create and use an instance

We described the _definition_ of a struct. Now let's see how to initialize a struct and use it. A
struct can be initialized using the `struct_name { field1: value1, field2: value2, ... }` syntax.
The fields can be initialized in any order, and all of the required fields must be set.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/struct.move anchor=pack

```

In the example above, we create an instance of the `Artist` struct and set the `name` field to a
string "The Beatles".

To access the fields of a struct, you can use the `.` operator followed by the field name.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/struct.move anchor=access

```

Only the module defining the struct can access its fields (both mutably and immutably). So the above
code should be in the same module as the `Artist` struct.

<!-- ## Accessing Fields

Struct fields are private and can be accessed only by the module defining the struct. To access the fields of a struct, you can use the `.` operator followed by the field name.

```move
# anchor: access file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/struct.move anchor=access
```
-->

## Unpacking a struct

Structs are non-discardable by default, meaning that the initialized struct value must be used,
either by storing it or unpacking it. Unpacking a struct means deconstructing it into its fields.
This is done using the `let` keyword followed by the struct name and the field names.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/struct.move anchor=unpack

```

In the example above we unpack the `Artist` struct and create a new variable `name` with the value
of the `name` field. Because the variable is not used, the compiler will raise a warning. To
suppress the warning, you can use the underscore `_` to indicate that the variable is intentionally
unused.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/struct.move anchor=unpack_ignore

```

<!-- FILE: move-basics/abilities-introduction.md -->

# Abilities: Introduction

Move has a unique type system which allows customizing _type abilities_.
[In the previous section](./struct), we introduced the `struct` definition and how to use it.
However, the instances of the `Artist` and `Record` structs had to be unpacked for the code to
compile. This is default behavior of a struct without _abilities_.

> Throughout the book you will see chapters with name `Ability: <name>`, where `<name>` is the name
> of the ability. These chapters will cover the ability in detail, how it works, and how to use it
> in Move.

## What are Abilities?

Abilities are a way to allow certain behaviors for a type. They are a part of the struct declaration
and define which behaviors are allowed for the instances of the struct.

## Abilities Syntax

Abilities are set in the struct definition using the `has` keyword followed by a list of abilities.
The abilities are separated by commas. Move supports 4 abilities: `copy`, `drop`, `key`, and
`store`. Each ability defines a specific behavior for the struct instances.

```move
/// This struct has the `copy` and `drop` abilities.
public struct VeryAble has copy, drop {
    // field: Type1,
    // field2: Type2,
    // ...
}
```

## Overview

A quick overview of the abilities:

> All of the built-in types except [references](references) have `copy`, `drop`, and `store`
> abilities. References have `copy` and `drop`.

- `copy` - allows the struct to be _copied_. Explained in the [Ability: Copy](./copy-ability)
  chapter.
- `drop` - allows the struct to be _dropped_ or _discarded_. Explained in the
  [Ability: Drop](./drop-ability) chapter.
- `key` - allows the struct to be used as a _key_ in a storage. Explained in the
  [Ability: Key](./../storage/key-ability) chapter.
- `store` - allows the struct to be _stored_ in structs that have the _key_ ability. Explained in
  the [Ability: Store](./../storage/store-ability) chapter.

While it is important to briefly mention them here, we will go into more detail about each ability
in the following chapters and give proper context on how to use them.

## No Abilities

A struct without abilities cannot be discarded, copied, or stored in storage. We call such a struct
a _Hot Potato_. A lighthearted name, but it is a good way to remember that a struct without
abilities is like a hot potato - it can only be passed around and requires special handling. The Hot
Potato is one of the most powerful patterns in Move, and we go into more detail about it in the
[Hot Potato Pattern](./../programmability/hot-potato-pattern) chapter.

Notes:
    - compare them to primitive types introduces before;
    - what is an ability without drop
    - drop is not necessary for unpacking
    - make a joke about a bacteria pattern in the code
    - mention that a struct with only `drop` ability is called a Witness
    - mention that a struct without abilities is called a Hot Potato
    - mention that there are two more abilities which are covered in a later chapter

Links:
    - language reference (abilities)
    - authorization patterns (or witness)
    - hot potato pattern
    - key and store abilities (later chapter)

 -->

The `drop` ability - the simplest of them - allows the instance of a struct to be _ignored_ or
_discarded_. In many programming languages this behavior is considered default. However, in Move, a
struct without the `drop` ability is not allowed to be ignored. This is a safety feature of the Move
language, which ensures that all assets are properly handled. An attempt to ignore a struct without
the `drop` ability will result in a compilation error.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/drop-ability.move anchor=main

```

The `drop` ability is often used on custom collection types to eliminate the need for special
handling of the collection when it is no longer needed. For example, a `vector` type has the `drop`
ability, which allows the vector to be ignored when it is no longer needed. However, the biggest
feature of Move's type system is the ability to not have `drop`. This ensures that the assets are
properly handled and not ignored.

A struct with a single `drop` ability is called a _Witness_. We explain the concept of a _Witness_
in the [Witness and Abstract Implementation](./../programmability/witness-pattern) section.

## Types with the `drop` Ability

All native types in Move have the `drop` ability. This includes:

- [`bool`](./../move-basics/primitive-types#booleans)
- [unsigned integers](./../move-basics/primitive-types#integer-types)
- [`vector<T>`](./../move-basics/vector) when `T` has `drop`
- [`address`](./../move-basics/address)

All of the types defined in the standard library have the `drop` ability as well. This includes:

- [`Option<T>`](./../move-basics/option) when `T` has `drop`
- [`String`](./../move-basics/string)
- [`TypeName`](./../move-basics/type-reflection)

# Importing Modules

<!--
    TODO: create a better example for:
        1. Importing a module in general
        2. Importing a member
        3. Importing multiple members
        4. Grouping imports
        5. Self keyword for groups
-->

<!--

Goals:
    - Show the import syntax
    - Local dependencies
    - External dependencies
    - Importing modules from other packages

 -->

Move achieves high modularity and code reuse by allowing module imports. Modules within the same
package can import each other, and a new package can depend on already existing packages and use
their modules too. This section will cover the basics of importing modules and how to use them in
your own code.

## Importing a Module

Modules defined in the same package can import each other. The `use` keyword is followed by the
module path, which consists of the package address (or alias) and the module name separated by `::`.

```move title="File: sources/module_one.move" file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/importing-modules.move anchor=module_one

```

Another module defined in the same package can import the first module using the `use` keyword.

```move title="File: sources/module_two.move" file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/importing-modules-two.move anchor=module_two

```

> Note: Any item (struct, function, constant, etc.) that you want to import from another module must
> be marked with the `public` (or `public(package)` - see [visibility modifiers](./visibility))
> keyword to make it accessible outside its defining module. For example, the `Character` struct and
> the `new` function in `module_one` are marked public so they can be used in `module_two`.

## Importing Members

You can also import specific members from a module. This is useful when you only need a single
function or a single type from a module. The syntax is the same as for importing a module, but you
add the member name after the module path.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/importing-modules-members.move anchor=members

```

## Grouping Imports

Imports can be grouped into a single `use` statement using curly braces `{}`. This allows for
cleaner and more organized code when importing multiple members from the same module or package.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/importing-modules-grouped.move anchor=grouped

```

Importing function names is less common in Move, since the function names can overlap and cause
confusion. A recommended practice is to import the entire module and use the module path to access
the function. Types have unique names and should be imported individually.

To import members and the module itself in the group import, you can use the `Self` keyword. The
`Self` keyword refers to the module itself and can be used to import the module and its members.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/importing-modules-self.move anchor=self

```

## Resolving Name Conflicts

When importing multiple members from different modules, it is possible to have name conflicts. For
example, if you import two modules that both have a function with the same name, you will need to
use the module path to access the function. It is also possible to have modules with the same name
in different packages. To resolve the conflict and avoid ambiguity, Move offers the `as` keyword to
rename the imported member.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/importing-modules-conflict-resolution.move anchor=conflict

```

## Adding an External Dependency

Move packages can depend on other packages; the dependencies are listed in the
[Package Manifest](./../concepts/manifest) file called `Move.toml`.

Package dependencies are defined in the [Package Manifest](./../concepts/manifest) as follows:

```ini title="Move.toml"
[dependencies]
Example = { git = "https://github.com/Example/example.git", subdir = "path/to/package", rev = "v1.2.3" }
Local = { local = "../my_other_package" }
```

The `dependencies` section contains an entry for each package dependency. The key of the entry is
the name of the package (`Example` or `Local` in the example), and the value is either a git import
table or a local path. The git import contains the URL of the package, the subdirectory where the
package is located, and the revision of the package. The local path is a relative path to the qa
package directory.

If you add a dependency, all of its dependencies also become available to your package.

If a dependency is added to the `Move.toml` file, the compiler will automatically fetch (and later
refetch) the dependencies when building the package.

> Starting with version 1.45 of the sui CLI, the system packages are automatically included as
> dependencies for all packages if they are not present in `Move.toml`. Therefore, `MoveStdlib`,
> `Sui`, `System`, `Bridge`, and `Deepbook` are all available without an explicit import.

## Importing a Module from Another Package

Normally, packages define their addresses in the `[addresses]` section. You can use aliases instead
of full addresses. For example, instead of using `0x2::coin` to reference the Sui `coin` module, you
can use `sui::coin`. The `sui` alias is defined in the Sui Framework package's manifest. Similarly,
the `std` alias is defined in the Standard Library package and can be used instead of `0x1` to
access standard library modules.

To import a module from another package, use the `use` keyword followed by the module path. The
module path consists of the package address (or alias) and the module name, separated by `::`.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/importing-modules-external.move anchor=external

```

> Note: Module address names come from the `[addresses]` section of the manifest file (`Move.toml`),
> not the names used in the `[dependencies]` section.

# Standard Library

<!-- The Move standard library provides a set of modules  -->

The Move Standard Library provides functionality for native types and operations. It is a standard
collection of modules that do not interact with storage, but provide basic tools for working with
and manipulating data. It is the only dependency of the
[Sui Framework](./../programmability/sui-framework), and is imported together with it.

## Most Common Modules

In this book we go into detail about most of the modules in the Standard Library, however, it is
also helpful to give an overview of the features, so that you can get a sense of what is available
and which module implements it.

## Integer Modules

The Move Standard Library provides a set of functions associated with integer types. These functions
are split into multiple modules, each associated with a specific integer type. The modules should
not be imported directly, as their functions are available on every integer value.

> All of the modules provide the same set of functions. Namely, `max`, `diff`,
> `divide_and_round_up`, `sqrt` and `pow`.

| [std::u256](https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/std/u256) | Functions for the `u256` type |

</div>

## Exported Addresses

The Standard Library exports a single named address - `std = 0x1`. Note the alias `std` is defined
here.

```toml
[addresses]
std = "0x1"
```

## Implicit Imports

Some modules are imported implicitly and are available in the module without the explicit `use`
import. For the Standard Library, these modules and types include:

- std::vector
- std::option
- std::option::Option

## Importing std without Sui Framework

The Move Standard Library can be imported to the package directly. However, `std` alone is not
enough to build a meaningful application, as it does not provide any storage capabilities and can't
interact with the on-chain state.

```toml
MoveStdlib = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/move-stdlib", rev = "framework/mainnet" }
```

## Source Code

The source code of the Move Standard Library is available in the
[Sui repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-framework/packages/move-stdlib/sources).


<!-- FILE: move-basics/vector.md -->

# Vector

Vectors are a native way to store collections of elements in Move. They are similar to arrays in
other programming languages, but with a few differences. In this section, we introduce the `vector`
type and its operations.

## Vector syntax

The `vector` type is written using the `vector` keyword followed by the type of the elements in
angle brackets. The type of the elements can be any valid Move type, including other vectors.

Move has a vector literal syntax that allows you to create vectors using the `vector` keyword
followed by square brackets containing the elements (or no elements for an empty vector).

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/vector.move anchor=literal

```

The `vector` type is a built-in type in Move, and does not need to be imported from a module.
Vector operations are defined in the `std::vector` module, which is implicitly imported
and can be used directly without explicit `use` import.

## Vector operations

The standard library provides methods to manipulate vectors. The following are some of the most
commonly used operations:

- `push_back`: Adds an element to the end of the vector.
- `pop_back`: Removes the last element from the vector.
- `length`: Returns the number of elements in the vector.
- `is_empty`: Returns true if the vector is empty.
- `remove`: Removes an element at a given index.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/vector.move anchor=methods

```

## Destroying a Vector of non-droppable types

A vector of non-droppable types cannot be discarded. If you define a vector of types without the
`drop` ability, the vector value cannot be ignored. If the vector is empty, the compiler requires an
explicit call to the `destroy_empty` function.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/vector.move anchor=no_drop

```

The `destroy_empty` function will fail at runtime if you call it on a non-empty vector.

<!-- FILE: move-basics/option.md -->

# Option

`Option` is a type that represents an optional value which may or may not exist. The concept of
`Option` in Move is borrowed from Rust, and it is a very useful primitive in Move. `Option` is
defined in the [Standard Library](./standard-library), and is defined as follows:

```move
module std::option;

/// Abstraction of a value that may or may not be present.
public struct Option<Element> has copy, drop, store {
    vec: vector<Element>
}
```

_See [full documentation for std::option][option-stdlib] module._

> The 'std::option' module is implicitly imported in every module, so you don't need to add an
> explicit import.

The `Option` type is a generic type with an `Element` type parameter. It contains a single field,
`vec`, which is a `vector` of `Element`. The vector can have a length of 0 or 1, representing the
absence or presence of a value, respectively.

> Note: You might be surprised that `Option` is a `struct` containing a `vector` instead of an
> [enum][enum-reference]. This is for historical reasons: `Option` was added to Move before it had
> support for enums.

The `Option` type has two variants: `Some` and `None`. The `Some` variant contains a value, while
the `None` variant represents the absence of a value. The `Option` type is used to represent the
absence of a value in a type-safe way, avoiding the need for empty or `undefined` values.

## In Practice

To showcase why the `Option` type is necessary, let's look at an example. Consider an application
which takes a user input and stores it in a variable. Some fields are required, and some are
optional. For example, a user's middle name is optional. While we could use an empty string to
represent the absence of a middle name, it would require extra checks to differentiate between an
empty string and a missing middle name. Instead, we can use the `Option` type to represent the
middle name.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/option.move anchor=registry

```

In the previous example, the `middle_name` field is of type `Option<String>`. This means that the
`middle_name` field can either contain a String value, wrapped in Some, or be explicitly empty,
represented by None. Using the `Option` type makes the optional nature of the field clear, avoiding
ambiguity and the need for extra checks to differentiate between an empty string and a missing
middle name.

## Creating and Using Option values

The `Option` type, along with the `std::option` module, is implicitly imported in Move. This means
you can use the `Option` type directly without needing a `use` statement.

To create a value of the `Option` type, you can use the `option::some` or `option::none` methods.
`Option` values also support several operations (borrowing will be discussed in the
[references](references#references-1) chapter):

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/option.move anchor=usage

```

# String

While Move does not have a built-in type to represent strings, it does have two standard
implementations for strings in the [Standard Library](./standard-library). The `std::string` module
defines a `String` type and methods for UTF-8 encoded strings, and the second module, `std::ascii`,
provides an ASCII `String` type and its methods.

> The Sui execution environment automatically converts bytevector into `String` in transaction
> inputs. As a result, in many cases, constructing a String directly within the
> [Transaction Block](./../concepts/what-is-a-transaction) is unnecessary.

<!--

## Bytestring Literal

TODO:

- reference vector
- reference literals - [Expression](./expression#literals)

-->

## Strings are bytes

No matter which type of string you use, it is important to know that strings are just bytes. The
wrappers provided by the `string` and `ascii` modules are just that: wrappers. They do provide
safety checks and methods to work with strings, but at the end of the day, they are just vectors of
bytes.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/string.move anchor=custom

```

## Working with UTF-8 Strings

While there are two types of strings (`string` and `ascii`) in the standard library, the `string`
module should be considered the default. It has native implementations of many common operations,
leveraging low-level, optimized runtime code for superior performance. In contrast, the `ascii`
module is fully implemented in Move, relying on higher-level abstractions and making it less
suitable for performance-critical tasks.

### Definition

The `String` type in the `std::string` module is defined as follows:

```move
module std::string;

/// A `String` holds a sequence of bytes which is guaranteed to be in utf8 format.
public struct String has copy, drop, store {
    bytes: vector<u8>,
}
```

_See [full documentation for std::string][string-stdlib] module._

### Creating a String

To create a new UTF-8 `String` instance, you can use the `string::utf8` method. The
[Standard Library](./standard-library) provides an alias `.to_string()` on the `vector<u8>` for
convenience.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/string.move anchor=utf8

```

### Common Operations

UTF8 String provides a number of methods to work with strings. The most common operations on strings
are: concatenation, slicing, and getting the length. Additionally, for custom string operations, the
`bytes()` method can be used to get the underlying byte vector.

```move
let mut str = b"Hello,".to_string();
let another = b" World!".to_string();

// append(String) adds the content to the end of the string
str.append(another);

// `sub_string(start, end)` copies a slice of the string
str.sub_string(0, 5); // "Hello"

// `length()` returns the number of bytes in the string
str.length(); // 12 (bytes)

// methods can also be chained! Get a length of a substring
str.sub_string(0, 5).length(); // 5 (bytes)

// whether the string is empty
str.is_empty(); // false

// get the underlying byte vector for custom operations
let bytes: &vector<u8> = str.bytes();
```

### Safe UTF-8 Operations

The default `utf8` method may abort if the bytes passed into it are not valid UTF-8. If you are not
sure that the bytes you are passing are valid, you should use the `try_utf8` method instead. It
returns an `Option<String>`, which contains no value if the bytes are not valid UTF-8, and a string
otherwise.

> Hint: Functions with names starting with `try_*` typically return an `Option`. If the operation
> succeeds, the result is wrapped in `Some`. If it fails, the function returns `None`. This naming
> convention, commonly used in Move, is inspired by Rust.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/string.move anchor=safe_utf8

```

### UTF-8 Limitations

The `string` module does not provide a way to access individual characters in a string. This is
because UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding, and the length of a character can be anywhere from 1 to
4 bytes. Similarly, the `length()` method returns the number of bytes in the string, not the number
of characters.

However, methods like `sub_string` and `insert` validate character boundaries and abort if the
specified index falls within the middle of a character.

# Control Flow

<!--

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Introduce control flow statements.
Notes:
    - if/else is an expression
    - while () {} loop
    - continue and break
    - loop {}
    - infinite loop is possible but will lead to gas exhaustion
    - return keyword
    - if is an expression and as such requires a semicolon (!!!)

Links:
    - reference (control flow)
    - coding conventions (control flow)

 -->

Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They are used to
make decisions, repeat a block of code, or exit a block of code early. Move includes the following
control flow statements (explained in detail below):

- [`if` and `if-else`](#conditional-statements) - making decisions on whether to execute a block of
  code
- [`loop` and `while` loops](#repeating-statements-with-loops) - repeating a block of code
- [`break` and `continue` statements](#exiting-a-loop-early) - exiting a loop early
- [`return`](#early-return) statement - exiting a function early

## Conditional Statements

The `if` expression is used to make decisions in a program. It evaluates a
[boolean expression](./expression#literals) and executes a block of code if the expression is true.
Paired with `else`, it can execute a different block of code if the expression is false.

The syntax for an `if` expression is:

```move
if (<bool_expression>) <expression>;
if (<bool_expression>) <expression> else <expression>;
```

Just like any other expression, `if` requires a semicolon if there are other expressions following
it. The `else` keyword is optional, except when the resulting value is assigned to a variable, as
all branches must return a value to ensure type safety. Let’s examine how an `if` expression works
in Move with the following example:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/control-flow.move anchor=if_condition

```

Let's see how we can use `if` and `else` to assign a value to a variable:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/control-flow.move anchor=if_else

```

In this example, the value of the `if` expression is assigned to the variable `y`. If `x` is greater
than 0, `y` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, it is assigned 0. The `else` block is required
because both branches of the `if` expression must return a value of the same type. Omitting the
`else` block would result in a compiler error, as it ensures all possible branches are accounted for
and type safety is maintained.

<!-- TODO: add an error -->

Conditional expressions are among the most important control flow statements in Move. They evaluate
user-provided input or stored data to make decisions. One key use case is in the
[`assert!` macro](./assert-and-abort), which checks if a condition is true and aborts execution if
it is not. We’ll explore this in detail shortly.

## Repeating Statements with Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. Move has two built-in types of loops:
`loop` and `while`. In many cases they can be used interchangeably, but usually `while` is used when
the number of iterations is known in advance, and `loop` is used when the number of iterations is
not known in advance or there are multiple exit points.

Loops are useful for working with collections, such as vectors, or for repeating a block of code
until a specific condition is met. However, take care to avoid infinite loops, which can exhaust gas
limits and cause the transaction to abort.

## The `while` Loop

The `while` statement executes a block of code repeatedly as long as the associated boolean
expression evaluates to true. Just like we've seen with `if`, the boolean expression is evaluated
before each iteration of the loop. Additionally, like conditional statements, the `while` loop is an
expression and requires a semicolon if there are other expressions following it.

The syntax for the `while` loop is:

```move
while (<bool_expression>) { <expressions>; };
```

Here is an example of a `while` loop with a very simple condition:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/control-flow.move anchor=while_loop

```

## Infinite `loop`

Now let's imagine a scenario where the boolean expression is always `true`. For example, if we
literally passed `true` to the `while` condition. This is similar to how the `loop` statement
functions, except that `while` evaluates a condition.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/control-flow.move anchor=infinite_while

```

An infinite `while` loop, or a `while` loop with an always `true` condition, is equivalent to a
`loop`. The syntax for creating a `loop` is straightforward:

```move
loop { <expressions>; };
```

Let's rewrite the previous example using `loop` instead of `while`:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/control-flow.move anchor=infinite_loop

```

Infinite loops are rarely practical in Move, as every operation consumes gas, and an infinite loop
will inevitably lead to gas exhaustion. If you find yourself using a loop, consider whether there
might be a better approach, as many use cases can be handled more efficiently with other control
flow structures. That said, `loop` might be useful when combined with `break` and `continue`
statements to create controlled and flexible looping behavior.

## Exiting a Loop Early

As we already mentioned, infinite loops are rather useless on their own. And that's where we
introduce the `break` and `continue` statements. They are used to exit a loop early, and to skip the
rest of the current iteration, respectively.

Syntax for the `break` statement is (without a semicolon):

```move
break
```

The `break` statement is used to stop the execution of a loop and exit it early. It is often used in
combination with a conditional statement to exit the loop when a certain condition is met. To
illustrate this point, let's turn the infinite `loop` from the previous example into something that
looks and behaves more like a `while` loop:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/control-flow.move anchor=break_loop

```

Almost identical to the `while` loop, right? The `break` statement is used to exit the loop when `x`
is 5. If we remove the `break` statement, the loop will run forever, just like in the previous
example.

## Skipping an Iteration

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and start the next one.
Similarly to `break`, it is used in combination with a conditional statement to skip the rest of an
iteration when a certain condition is met.

Syntax for the `continue` statement is (without a semicolon):

```move
continue
```

The example below skips odd numbers and prints only even numbers from 0 to 10:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/control-flow.move anchor=continue_loop

```

`break` and `continue` statements can be used in both `while` and `loop` loops.

## Early Return

The `return` statement is used to exit a [function](./function) early and return a value. It is
often used in combination with a conditional statement to exit the function when a certain condition
is met. The syntax for the `return` statement is:

```move
return <expression>
```

Here is an example of a function that returns a value when a certain condition is met:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/control-flow.move anchor=return_statement

```

Unlike in many other languages, the `return` statement is not required for the last expression in a
function. The last expression in a function block is automatically returned. However, the `return`
statement is useful when we want to exit a function early if a certain condition is met.

<!-- FILE: move-basics/enum-and-match.md -->

# Enums and Match

An enum is a user-defined data structure that, unlike a [struct](./struct), can represent multiple
variants. Each variant can contain primitive types, structs, or other enums. However, recursive enum
definitions — similar to recursive struct definitions — are not allowed.

## Definition

An enum is defined using the `enum` keyword, followed by optional abilities and a block of variant
definitions. Each variant has a tag name and may optionally include either positional values or
named fields. Enum must have at least one variant. The structure of each variant is not flexible,
and the total number of variants can be relatively large - up to 100.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and-match.move anchor=definition

```

In the code sample above we defined a public `Segment` enum, which has the `drop` and `copy`
abilities, and 3 variants:

- `Empty`, which has no fields.
- `String`, which contains a single positional field of type `String`.
- `Special`, which uses named fields: `content` of type `vector<u8>` and `encoding` of type `u8`.

## Instantiating

Enums are _internal_ to the module in which they are defined. This means an enum can only be
constructed, read, and unpacked within the same module.

[Similar to structs](./struct#create-and-use-an-instance), enums are instantiated by specifying the
type, the variant, and the values for any fields defined in that variant.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and-match.move anchor=constructors

```

Depending on the use case, you may want to provide public constructors, or instantiate enums
internally as a part of application logic.

## Using in Type Definitions

The biggest benefit of using enums is the ability to represent varying data structures under a
single type. To demonstrate this, let’s define a struct that contains a vector of `Segment` values:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and-match.move anchor=struct

```

All variants of the Segment enum share the same type – `Segment` – which allows us to create a
homogeneous vector containing instances of different variants. This kind of flexibility is not
achievable with structs, as each struct defines a single, fixed shape.

## Pattern Matching

Unlike structs, enums require special handling when it comes to accessing the inner value or
checking the variant. We simply cannot read the inner fields of an enum using the `.` (dot) syntax,
because we need to make sure that the value we are trying to access is the right one. For that Move
offers _pattern matching_ syntax.

> This chapter doesn't intend to cover all the features of pattern matching in Move. Refer to the
> [Pattern Matching](./../../reference/control-flow/pattern-matching) section in the Move Reference.

Pattern matching allows conditioning the logic based on the _pattern_ of the value. It is performed
using the `match` expression, followed by the matched value in parenthesis and the block of _match
arms_, defining the pattern and expression to be performed if the pattern is right.

Let's extend our example by adding a set of `is_variant`-like functions, so external packages can
check the variant. Starting with `is_empty`.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and-match.move anchor=is_empty

```

The `match` keyword begins the expression, and `s` is the value being tested. Each match arm checks
for a specific variant of the `Segment` enum. If `s` matches `Segment::Empty`, the function returns
`true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

For variants with fields, we need to bind the inner structure to local variables (even if we don’t
use them, marking unused values with `_` to avoid compiler warnings).

### Trick #1 - _any_ Condition

The Move compiler infers the type of the value used in a `match` expression and ensures that the
_match arms_ are exhaustive – that is, all possible variants or values must be covered.

However, in some cases, such as matching on a primitive value or a collection like a vector, it's
not feasible to list every possible case. For these situations, match supports a wildcard pattern
(`_`), which acts as a default arm. This arm is executed when no other patterns match.

We can demonstrate this by simplifying our `is_empty` function and replacing the non-`Empty`
variants with a wildcard:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and-match.move anchor=is_empty_2
public fun is_empty(s: &Segment): bool {

```

Similarly, we can use the same approach to define `is_special` and `is_string`:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and-match.move anchor=accessors

```

### Trick #2 - `try_into` Helpers

With the addition of `is_variant` functions, we enabled external modules to check which variant an
enum instance represents. However, this is often not enough – external code still cannot access the
inner value of a variant due to enums being internal to their module.

A common pattern for addressing this is to define `try_into` functions. These functions match on the
value and return an `Option` containing the inner contents if the `match` succeeds.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and-match.move anchor=try_into_inner_string

```

This pattern safely exposes internal data in a controlled way, avoiding abort.

### Trick #3 - Matching on Primitive Values

The `match` expression in Move can be used with values of any type – enums, structs, or primitives.
To demonstrate this, let’s implement a `to_string` function that creates a new `String` from a
`Segment`. In the case of the `Special` variant, we will match on the `encoding` field to determine
how to decode the content.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and-match.move anchor=to_string

```

This function demonstrates two key things:

- Nested `match` expressions can be used for deeper logic branching.
- Wildcards are essential for covering all possible values in primitive types like `u8`.

## The Final Test

Now we can finalize the test we started before using the features we have added. Let's create a
scenario where we build enums into a vector.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and-match-2.move anchor=enum_test

```

This test demonstrates the full enum workflow: instantiating different variants, using public
accessors, and performing logic with pattern matching. That should be enough to get you started!

To learn more about enums and pattern matching, refer to the resources listed in the
[further reading](#further-reading) section.

## Summary

- Enums are user-defined types that can represent multiple variants under a single type.
- Each variant can contain different types of data (primitives, structs, or other enums).
- Enums are internal to their defining module and require pattern matching for access.
- Pattern matching is done using the `match` expression, which:
  - Works with enums, structs, and primitive values;
  - Must handle all possible cases (be exhaustive);
  - Supports the `_` wildcard pattern for remaining cases;
  - Can return values and be used in expressions;
- Common patterns for enums include `is_variant` checks and `try_into` helper functions.

# Constants

<!--

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Introduce constants.
Notes:
    - constants are immutable
    - constants are private
    - start with a capital letter always
    - stored in the bytecode (but w/o a name)
    - mention standard for naming constants

Links:
    - next section (abort and assert)
    - coding conventions (constants)
    - constants (language reference)

 -->

Constants are immutable values that are defined at the module level. They often serve as a way to
give names to static values that are used throughout a module. For example, if there's a default
price for a product, you might define a constant for it. Constants are stored in the module's
bytecode, and each time they are used, the value is copied.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/constants-shop-price.move anchor=shop_price

```

## Naming Convention

Constants must start with a capital letter - this is enforced at the compiler level. For constants
used as a value, the convention is to use all uppercase letters and underscores between words, which
makes constants stand out from other identifiers in the code. An exception is made for
[error constants](./assert-and-abort#error-constants), which are written in ECamelCase.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/constants-naming.move anchor=naming

```

## Constants are Immutable

Constants can't be changed and assigned new values. As part of the package bytecode, they are
inherently immutable.

```move
module book::immutable_constants;

const ITEM_PRICE: u64 = 100;

// emits an error
fun change_price() {
    ITEM_PRICE = 200;
}
```

## Using Config Pattern

A common use case for an application is to define a set of constants that are used throughout the
codebase. But due to constants being private to the module, they can't be accessed from other
modules. One way to solve this is to define a "config" module that exports the constants.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/constants-config.move anchor=config

```

This way other modules can import and read the constants, and the update process is simplified. If
the constants need to be changed, only the config module needs to be updated during the package
upgrade.

# Aborting Execution

<!-- Consider "aborting execution" -->

<!--

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Introduce abort keyword and `assert!` macro.
Notes:
    - previous chapter mentions constants
    - error constants standard ECamelCase
    - `assert!` macro
    - asserts should go before the main logic
    - Move has no catch mechanism
    - abort codes are local to the module
    - there are no error messages emitted
    - error codes should handle all possible scenarios in this module

Links:
    - constants (previous section)
 -->

A transaction can either succeed or fail. Successful execution applies all changes made to objects
and on-chain data, and the transaction is committed to the blockchain. Alternatively, if a
transaction aborts, changes are not applied. Use the `abort` keyword to abort a transaction and
revert any changes that were made.

> It is important to note that there is no catch mechanism in Move. If a transaction aborts, the
> changes made so far are reverted, and the transaction is considered failed.

## Abort

The `abort` keyword is used to abort the execution of a transaction. It is used in combination with
an abort code, which is returned to the caller of the transaction. The abort code is an
[integer](./primitive-types) of type `u64`.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/assert-and-abort.move anchor=abort

```

The code above will, of course, abort with abort code `1`.

## assert!

The `assert!` macro is a built-in macro that can be used to assert a condition. If the condition is
false, the transaction will abort with the given abort code. The `assert!` macro is a convenient way
to abort a transaction if a condition is not met. The macro shortens the code otherwise written with
an `if` expression + `abort`. The `code` argument is optional, but has to be a `u64` value or an
`#[error]` (see below for more information).

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/assert-and-abort.move anchor=assert

```

## Error constants

To make error codes more descriptive, it is a good practice to define
[error constants](./constants). Error constants are defined as `const` declarations and are usually
prefixed with `E` followed by a camel case name. Error constants are similar to other constants and
do not have any special handling. However, they are commonly used to improve code readability and
make abort scenarios easier to understand.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/assert-and-abort.move anchor=error_const

```

## Error messages

Move 2024 introduces a special type of error constant, marked with the `#[error]` attribute. This
attribute allows the error constant to be of type `vector<u8>` and can be used to store an error
message.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/assert-and-abort.move anchor=error_attribute

```

<!-- FILE: move-basics/function.md -->

# Functions

Functions are the building blocks of Move programs. They are called from
[user transactions](./../concepts/what-is-a-transaction) and from other functions and group
executable code into reusable units. Functions can take arguments and return a value. They are
declared with the `fun` keyword at the module level. Just like any other module member, by default
they're private and can only be accessed from within the module.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/function.move anchor=math

```

In this example, we define a function `add` that takes two arguments of type `u64` and returns their
sum. The `test_add` function, located in the same module, is a test function that calls `add`. The
test uses the `assert!` macro to compare the result of `add` with the expected value. If the
condition inside `assert!` evaluates to false, the execution is aborted automatically.

## Function declaration

> In Move, functions are typically named using the `snake_case` convention. This means function
> names should be all lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Examples include
> `do_something`, `add`, `get_balance`, `is_authorized`, and so on.

A function is declared with the `fun` keyword followed by the function name (a valid Move
identifier), a list of arguments in parentheses, and a return type. The function body is a block of
code that contains a sequence of statements and expressions. The last expression the function body
is the return value of the function.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/function.move anchor=return_nothing

```

## Accessing functions

Just like other module members, functions can be imported and accessed using a path. The path
consists of the module path and the function name, separated by ::. For example, if you have a
function named `add` in the `math` module within the `book` package, its full path would be
`book::math::add`. If the module has already been imported, you can access it directly as
`math::add` as in the following example:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/function_use.move anchor=use_math

```

## Multiple return values

Move functions can return multiple values, which is particularly useful when you need to return more
than one piece of data from a function. The return type is specified as a tuple of types, and the
return value is provided as a tuple of expressions:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/function.move anchor=tuple_return

```

The result of a function call with a tuple return has to be unpacked into variables via the
`let (tuple)` syntax:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/function.move anchor=tuple_return_imm

```

If any of the declared values need to be declared as mutable, the `mut` keyword is placed before the
variable name:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/function.move anchor=tuple_return_mut

```

If some of the arguments are not used, they can be ignored with the `_` symbol:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/function.move anchor=tuple_return_ignore

```

<!-- FILE: move-basics/struct-methods.md -->

# Struct Methods

Move Compiler supports _receiver syntax_ `e.f()`, which allows defining methods which can be called
on instances of a struct. The term "receiver" specifically refers to the instance that receives the
method call. This is like the method syntax in other programming languages. It is a convenient way
to define functions that operate on the fields of a struct, providing direct access to the struct's
fields and creating cleaner, more intuitive code than passing the struct as a parameter.

## Method syntax

If the first argument of a function is a struct internal to the module that defines the function,
then the function can be called using the `.` operator. However, if the type of the first argument
is defined in another module, then method won't be associated with the struct by default. In this
case, the `.` operator syntax is not available, and the function must be called using standard
function call syntax.

When a module is imported, its methods are automatically associated with the struct.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/struct-methods.move anchor=hero

```

## Method Aliases

Method aliases help avoid name conflicts when modules define multiple structs and their methods.
They can also provide more descriptive method names for structs.

Here's the syntax:

```move
// for local method association
use fun function_path as Type.method_name;

// exported alias
public use fun function_path as Type.method_name;
```

> Public aliases are only allowed for structs defined in the same module. For structs defined in
> other modules, aliases can still be created but cannot be made public.

In the example below, we changed the `hero` module and added another type - `Villain`. Both `Hero`
and `Villain` have similar field names and methods. To avoid name conflicts, we prefixed methods
with `hero_` and `villain_` respectively. However, using aliases allows these methods to be called
on struct instances without the prefix:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/struct-methods-2.move anchor=hero_and_villain

```

In the test function, the `health` method is called directly on the `Hero` and `Villain` instances
without the prefix, as the compiler automatically associates the methods with their respective
structs.

> Note: In the test function, `hero.health()` is calling the aliased method, not directly accessing
> the private `health` field. While the `Hero` and `Villain` structs are public, their fields remain
> private to the module. The method call `hero.health()` uses the public alias defined by
> `public use fun hero_health as Hero.health`, which provides controlled access to the private
> field.

<!-- ## Aliasing an external module's method

It is also possible to associate a function defined in another module with a struct from the current
module. Following the same approach, we can create an alias for the method defined in another
module. Let's use the `bcs::to_bytes` method from the [Standard Library](./standard-library) and
associate it with the `Hero` struct. It will allow serializing the `Hero` struct to a vector of
bytes.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/struct-methods-3.move anchor=hero_to_bytes
``` -->

<!-- FILE: move-basics/visibility.md -->

# Visibility Modifiers

Every module member has a visibility. By default, all module members are _private_ - meaning they
are only accessible within the module they are defined in. However, you can add a visibility
modifier to make a module member _public_ - visible outside the module, or _public(package)_ -
visible in the modules within the same package, or _entry_ - can be called from a transaction but
can't be called from other modules.

## Internal Visibility

A function or a struct defined in a module which has no visibility modifier is _private_ to the
module. It can't be called from other modules.

```move
module book::internal_visibility;

// This function can be called from other functions in the same module
fun internal() { /* ... */ }

// Same module -> can call internal()
fun call_internal() {
    internal();
}
```

The following code will not compile:

<!-- TODO: add failure flag to example -->

```move
module book::try_calling_internal;

use book::internal_visibility;

// Different module -> can't call internal()
fun try_calling_internal() {
    internal_visibility::internal();
}
```

Note that just because a struct field is not visible from Move does not mean that its value is kept
confidential &mdash; it is always possible to read the contents of an on-chain object from outside
of Move. You should never store unencrypted secrets inside of objects.

## Public Visibility

A struct or a function can be made _public_ by adding the `public` keyword before the `fun` or
`struct` keyword.

```move
module book::public_visibility;

// This function can be called from other modules
public fun public_fun() { /* ... */ }
```

A public function can be imported and called from other modules. The following code will compile:

```move
module book::try_calling_public;

use book::public_visibility;

// Different module -> can call public_fun()
fun try_calling_public() {
    public_visibility::public_fun();
}
```

Unlike some languages, struct fields cannot be made public.

## Package Visibility

A function with _package_ visibility can be called from any module within the same package, but not
from modules in other packages. In other words, it is _internal_ to the package.

```move
module book::package_visibility;

public(package) fun package_only() { /* ... */ }
```

A package function can be called from any module within the same package:

```move
module book::try_calling_package;

use book::package_visibility;

// Same package `book` -> can call package_only()
fun try_calling_package() {
    package_visibility::package_only();
}
```

## Native Functions

Some functions in the [framework](./../programmability/sui-framework) and
[standard library](./standard-library) are marked with the `native` modifier. These functions are
natively provided by the Move VM and do not have a body in Move source code. To learn more about the
native modifier, refer to the
[Move Reference](./../../reference/functions?highlight=native#native-functions).

```move
module std::type_name;

public native fun get<T>(): TypeName;
```

This is an example from `std::type_name`, learn more about this module in the
[reflection chapter](./type-reflection).

<!-- FILE: move-basics/ownership-and-scope.md -->

# Ownership and Scope

Every variable in Move has a scope and an owner. The scope is the range of code where the variable
is valid, and the owner is the scope that this variable belongs to. Once the owner scope ends, the
variable is dropped. This is a fundamental concept in Move, and it is important to understand how it
works.

<!--

- Borrow Checker
- Mention Rust's borrow checker
- Borrowing / References intro

-->

## Ownership

A variable defined in a function scope is owned by this scope. The runtime goes through the function
scope and executes every expression and statement. After the function scope ends, the variables
defined in it are dropped or deallocated.

```move
module book::ownership;

public fun owner() {
    let a = 1; // a is owned by the `owner` function
} // a is dropped here

public fun other() {
    let b = 2; // b is owned by the `other` function
} // b is dropped here

#[test]
fun test_owner() {
    owner();
    other();
    // a & b are not valid here
}
```

In the example above, the variable `a` is owned by the `owner` function, and the variable `b` is
owned by the `other` function. When each of these functions are called, the variables are defined,
and when the function ends, the variables are discarded.

## Returning a Value

If we changed the `owner` function to return the variable `a`, then the ownership of `a` would be
transferred to the caller of the function.

```move
module book::ownership;

public fun owner(): u8 {
    let a = 1; // a defined here
    a // scope ends, a is returned
}

#[test]
fun test_owner() {
    let a = owner();
    // a is valid here
} // a is dropped here
```

## Passing by Value

Additionally, if we passed the variable `a` to another function, the ownership of `a` would be
transferred to this function. When performing this operation, we _move_ the value from one scope to
another. This is also called _move semantics_.

```move
module book::ownership;

public fun owner(): u8 {
    let a = 10;
    a
} // a is returned

public fun take_ownership(v: u8) {
    // v is owned by `take_ownership`
} // v is dropped here

#[test]
fun test_owner() {
    let a = owner();
    // `u8` is copyable, pass `move a` when calling the function to force the transfer of its ownership
    take_ownership(move a);
    // a is not valid here
}
```

## Scopes with Blocks

Each function has a main scope, and it can also have sub-scopes via the use of blocks. A block is a
sequence of statements and expressions, and it has its own scope. Variables defined in a block are
owned by this block, and when the block ends, the variables are dropped.

```move
module book::ownership;

public fun owner() {
    let a = 1; // a is owned by the `owner` function's scope
    {
        let b = 2; // the block that declares b owns it
        {
            let c = 3; // the block that declares c owns it
        }; // c is dropped here
    }; // b is dropped here
    // a = b; // error: b is not valid here
    // a = c; // error: c is not valid here
} // a is dropped here
```

However, if we return a value from a block, the ownership of the variable is transferred to the
caller of the block.

```move
module book::ownership;

public fun owner(): u8 {
    let a = 1; // a is owned by the `owner` function's scope
    let b = {
        let c = 2; // the block that declares c owns it
        c // c is returned from the block and transferred to b
    };
    a + b // both a and b are valid here
}
```

## Copyable Types

Some types in Move are _copyable_, which means that they can be copied without transferring
ownership. This is useful for types that are small and cheap to copy, such as integers and booleans.
The Move compiler will automatically copy these types when they are passed to or returned from a
function, or when they're _moved_ to another scope and then accessed in their original scope.

<!-- FILE: move-basics/copy-ability.md -->

# Abilities: Copy

In Move, the _copy_ ability on a type indicates that the instance or the value of the type can be
copied, or duplicated. While this behavior is provided by default when working with numbers or other
primitive types, it is not the default for custom types. Move is designed to express digital assets
and resources, and controlling the ability to duplicate resources is a key principle of the resource
model. However, the Move type system allows you to add the _copy_ ability to custom types:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/copy-ability.move anchor=copyable

```

In the example above, we define a custom type `Copyable` with the _copy_ ability. This means that
instances of `Copyable` can be copied, both implicitly and explicitly.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/copy-ability.move anchor=copyable_test

```

In the example above, `a` is copied to `b` implicitly, and then explicitly copied to `c` using the
dereference operator. If `Copyable` did not have the _copy_ ability, the code would not compile, and
the Move compiler would raise an error.

> Note: In Move, destructuring with empty brackets is often used to consume unused variables,
> especially for types without the drop ability. This prevents compiler errors from values going out
> of scope without explicit use. Also, Move requires the type name in destructuring (e.g.,
> `Copyable` in `let Copyable {} = a;`) because it enforces strict typing and ownership rules.

## Copying and Drop

The `copy` ability is closely related to the [`drop` ability](./drop-ability). If a type has the
_copy_ ability, it is very likely that it should have `drop` too. This is because the _drop_ ability
is required to clean up resources when the instance is no longer needed. If a type only has _copy_,
managing its instances gets more complicated, as the instances must be explicitly used or consumed.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/copy-ability.move anchor=copy_drop

```

All of the primitive types in Move behave as if they have the _copy_ and _drop_ abilities. This
means that they can be copied and dropped, and the Move compiler will handle the memory management
for them.

## Types with the `copy` Ability

All native types in Move have the `copy` ability. This includes:

- [bool](./../move-basics/primitive-types#booleans)
- [unsigned integers](./../move-basics/primitive-types#integer-types)
- [vector](./../move-basics/vector)
- [address](./../move-basics/address)

All of the types defined in the standard library have the `copy` ability as well. This includes:

- [Option](./../move-basics/option)
- [String](./../move-basics/string)
- [TypeName](./../move-basics/type-reflection)

    - show why passing by reference is useful
    - mention that reference comparison is faster
    - references can be both mutable and immutable

 -->

In the [Ownership and Scope](./ownership-and-scope) section, we explained that when a value is
passed to a function, it is _moved_ to the function's scope. This means that the function becomes
the owner of the value, and the original scope (owner) can no longer use it. This is an important
concept in Move, as it ensures that the value is not used in multiple places at the same time.
However, there are use cases when we want to pass a value to a function but retain ownership. This
is where references come into play.

To illustrate this, let's consider a simple example - an application for a metro (subway) pass. We
will look at 4 different scenarios where a card can be:

1. Purchased at a kiosk for a fixed price
2. Shown to an inspector to prove that the passenger has a valid pass
3. Used at the turnstile to enter the metro, and purchase a ride
4. Recycled after it's empty

## Layout

The initial layout of the metro pass application is simple. We define the `Card` type and the `USES`
[constant](./constants) that represents the number of rides on a single card. We also add
[error constants](./assert-and-abort#error-constants) for the case when the card is empty and when the card is not empty.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/references.move anchor=header_new
module book::metro_pass;


```

<!-- In [the previous section](./ownership-and-scope) we explained the ownership and scope in Move. We showed how the value is *moved* to a new scope, and how it changes the owner. In this section, we will explain how to *borrow* a reference to a value to avoid moving it, and how Move's *borrow checker* ensures that the references are used correctly. -->

## References

References are a way to _show_ a value to a function without giving up ownership. In our case, when
we show the Card to the inspector, we don't want to give up ownership of it, and we don't allow the
inspector to use up any of our rides. We just want to allow the _reading_ of the value of our Card
and to prove its ownership.

To do so, in the function signature, we use the `&` symbol to indicate that we are passing a
_reference_ to the value, not the value itself.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/references.move anchor=immutable

```

Because the function does not take ownership of the Card, it can _read_ its data but cannot _write_
to it, meaning it cannot modify the number of rides. Additionally, the function signature ensures
that it cannot be called without a Card instance. This is an important property that allows the
[Capability Pattern](./../programmability/capability), which we will cover in the next chapters.

Creating a reference to a value is often referred to as "borrowing" the value. For example, the
method to get a reference to the value wrapped by an `Option` is called `borrow`.

## Mutable Reference

In some cases, we want to allow the function to modify the Card. For example, when using the Card at
a turnstile, we need to deduct a ride. To achieve this, we use the `&mut` keyword in the function
signature.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/references.move anchor=mutable

```

As you can see in the function body, the `&mut` reference allows mutating the value, and the
function can spend rides.

## Passing by Value

Lastly, let's illustrate what happens when we pass the value itself to the function. In this case,
the function takes the ownership of the value, making it inaccessible in the original scope. The
owner of the Card can recycle it and thereby relinquish ownership to the function.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/references.move anchor=move

```

In the `recycle` function, the Card is passed by value, transferring ownership to the function. This
allows it to be unpacked and destroyed.

> Note: In Move, `_` is a wildcard pattern used in destructuring to ignore a field while still
> consuming the value. Destructuring must match all fields in a struct type. If a struct has fields,
> you must list all of them explicitly or use `_` to ignore unwanted fields.

## Full Example

To illustrate the full flow of the application, let's put all the pieces together in a test.

# Generics

Generics are a way to define a type or function that can work with any type. This is useful when you
want to write a function which can be used with different types, or when you want to define a type
that can hold any other type. Generics are the foundation of many advanced features in Move
including collections, abstract implementations, and more.

## In the Standard Library

In this chapter we already mentioned the [vector](./vector) type, which is a generic type that can
hold any other type. Another example of a generic type in the standard library is the
[Option](./option) type, which is used to represent a value that may or may not be present.

## Generic Syntax

To define a generic type or function, a type signature needs to have a list of generic parameters
enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`). The generic parameters are separated by commas.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/generics.move anchor=container

```

In the example above, `Container` is a generic type with a single type parameter `T`, the `value`
field of the container stores the `T`. The `new` function is a generic function with a single type
parameter `T`, and it returns a `Container` with the given value. Generic types must be initialized
with a concrete type, and generic functions must be called with a concrete type, although in some
cases the Move compiler can infer the correct type.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/generics.move anchor=test_container

```

In the test function `test_container`, we demonstrate three equivalent ways to create a new
`Container` with a `u8` value. Because numeric constants have ambiguous types, we must specify the
type of the number literal somewhere (in the type of the container, the parameter to `new`, or the
number literal itself); once we specify one of these the compiler can infer the others.

## Multiple Type Parameters

You can define a type or function with multiple type parameters. The type parameters are separated
by commas.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/generics.move anchor=pair

```

In the example above, `Pair` is a generic type with two type parameters `T` and `U`, and the
`new_pair` function is a generic function with two type parameters `T` and `U`. The function returns
a `Pair` with the given values. The order of the type parameters is important, and should match the
order of the type parameters in the type signature.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/generics.move anchor=test_pair

```

If we added another instance where we swapped type parameters in the `new_pair` function, and tried
to compare two types, we'd see that the type signatures are different, and cannot be compared.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/generics.move anchor=test_pair_swap

```

Since the types for `pair1` and `pair2` are different, the comparison `pair1 == pair2` will not
compile.

## Why Generics?

In the examples above we focused on instantiating generic types and calling generic functions to
create instances of these types. However, the real power of generics lies in their ability to define
shared behavior for the base, generic type, and then use it independently of the concrete types.
This is especially useful when working with collections, abstract implementations, and other
advanced features in Move.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/generics.move anchor=user

```

In the example above, `User` is a generic type with a single type parameter `T`, with shared fields
`name`, `age`, and the generic `metadata` field, which can store any type. No matter what `metadata`
is, all instances of `User` will contain the same fields and methods.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/generics.move anchor=update_user

```

## Phantom Type Parameters

In some cases, you may want to define a generic type with a type parameter that is not used in the
fields or methods of the type. This is called a _phantom type parameter_. Phantom type parameters
are useful when you want to define a type that can hold any other type, but you want to enforce some
constraints on the type parameter.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/generics.move anchor=phantom

```

The `Coin` type here does not contain any fields or methods that use the type parameter `T`. It is
used to differentiate between different types of coins, and to enforce some constraints on the type
parameter `T`.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/generics.move anchor=test_phantom

```

In the example above, we demonstrate how to create two different instances of `Coin` with different
phantom type parameters `USD` and `EUR`. The type parameter `T` is not used in the fields or methods
of the `Coin` type, but it is used to differentiate between different types of coins. This helps
ensure that the `USD` and `EUR` coins are not mistakenly mixed up.

## Constraints on Type Parameters

Type parameters can be constrained to have certain abilities. This is useful when you need the inner
type to allow certain behaviors, such as _copy_ or _drop_. The syntax for constraining a type
parameter is `T: <ability> + <ability>`.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/generics.move anchor=constraints

```

The Move Compiler will enforce that the type parameter `T` has the specified abilities. If the type
parameter does not have the specified abilities, the code will not compile.

```

<!-- FILE: move-basics/type-reflection.md -->

# Type Reflection

In programming languages, _reflection_ is the ability of a program to examine and modify its own
structure and behavior. Move has a limited form of reflection that allows you to inspect the type of
a value at runtime. This is useful when you need to store type information in a homogeneous
collection, or when you need to check if a type belongs to a package.

Type reflection is implemented in the [Standard Library](./standard-library) module
[`std::type_name`][type-name-stdlib]. Expressed very roughly, it gives a single function `get<T>()`
which returns the name of the type `T`.

## In practice

The module is straightforward, and operations allowed on the result are limited to getting a string
representation and extracting the module and address of the type.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/type-reflection.move anchor=main

```

<!-- FILE: move-basics/testing.md -->

# Testing

Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, especially in blockchain applications where
security and correctness are paramount. In this section, we will cover the fundamentals of testing
in Move, including how to write and organize tests effectively.

## The `#[test]` Attribute

Tests in Move are functions marked with the `#[test]` attribute. This attribute tells the compiler
that the function is a test function and should be run when tests are executed. Test functions are
regular functions, but they must take no arguments and have no return value. They are excluded from
the bytecode and are never published.

```move
module book::testing;

// The test attribute is placed before the `fun` keyword (can be both above or
// right before the `fun` keyword, as in `#[test] fun my_test() { ... }`)
// The name of the test in this case would be `book::testing::simple_test`.
#[test]
fun simple_test() {
    let sum = 2 + 2;
    assert!(sum == 4);
}

// The name of this test would be `book::testing::more_advanced_test`.
#[test] fun more_advanced_test() {
    let sum = 2 + 2 + 2;
    assert!(sum == 4);
}
```

## Running Tests

To run tests, you can use the `sui move test` command. This command will first build the package in
_test mode_ and then run all tests found in the package. In test mode, modules from both `sources/`
and `tests/` directories are processed and their tests executed.

```bash
$ sui move test
> UPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git
> INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Bridge
> INCLUDING DEPENDENCY DeepBook
> INCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiSystem
> INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui
> INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
> BUILDING book
> Running Move unit tests
> ...
```

<!-- TODO: fill output -->

## Test Fail Cases with `#[expected_failure]`

Tests for fail cases can be marked with `#[expected_failure]`. This attribute, when added to a
`#[test]` function, tells the compiler that the test is expected to fail. This is useful when you
want to test that a function fails when a certain condition is met.

> Note: This attribute can only be added to a `#[test]` function.

The attribute can take an argument specifying the expected abort code that should be returned if the
test fails. If the test returns an abort code different from the one specified in the argument, it
will fail. Likewise, if execution does not result in an abort, the test will also fail.

```move
module book::testing_failure;

const EInvalidArgument: u64 = 1;

#[test]
#[expected_failure(abort_code = 0)]
fun test_fail() {
    abort 0 // aborts with 0
}

// attributes can be grouped together
#[test, expected_failure(abort_code = EInvalidArgument)]
fun test_fail_1() {
    abort 1 // aborts with 1
}
```

The `abort_code` argument can use constants defined in the tests module as well as imported from
other modules. This is the only case where constants can be used and "accessed" in other modules.

## Utilities with `#[test_only]`

In some cases, it is helpful to give the test environment access to some internal functions or
features. This simplifies the testing process and allows for more thorough testing. However, it is
important to remember that these functions should not be included in the final package. This is
where the `#[test_only]` attribute comes in handy.

```move
module book::testing;

// Public function which uses the `secret` function.
public fun multiply_by_secret(x: u64): u64 {
    x * secret()
}

/// Private function which is not available to the public.
fun secret(): u64 { 100 }

#[test_only]
/// This function is only available for testing purposes in tests and other
/// test-only functions. Mind the visibility - for `#[test_only]` it is
/// common to use `public` visibility.
public fun secret_for_testing(): u64 {
    secret()
}

#[test]
// In the test environment we have access to the `secret_for_testing` function.
fun test_multiply_by_secret() {
    let expected = secret_for_testing() * 2;
    assert!(multiply_by_secret(2) == expected);
}
```

Functions marked with the `#[test_only]` will be available to the test environment, and to the other
modules if their visibility is set to `public`.

# Move - Language for Digital Assets

Smart-contract programming languages have historically focused on defining and managing digital
assets. For example, the ERC-20 standard in Ethereum pioneered a set of standards to interact with
digital currency tokens, establishing a blueprint for creating and managing digital currencies on
the blockchain. Subsequently, the introduction of the ERC-721 standard marked a significant
evolution, popularizing the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which represent unique,
indivisible assets. These standards laid the groundwork for the complex digital assets we see today.

<!-- ## Move and Digital Assets -->

<!-- note: consider "native" -> "fine-grained" -->

However, Ethereum's programming model lacked a native representation of assets. In other words,
externally, a Smart Contract behaved like an asset, but the language itself did not have a way to
inherently represent assets. From the start, Move aimed to provide a first-class abstraction for
assets, opening up new avenues for thinking about and programming assets.

<!-- Move was initially created in 2018 as part of the Libra project. The language was designed to address shortcomings in existing smart contract languages, especially in handling assets and access control. The Move language aims to provide first-class abstractions for these concepts, improving the safety and productivity of smart contract programming. -->

It is important to highlight which properties are essential for an asset:

- **Ownership:** Every asset is associated with an owner(s), mirroring the straightforward concept
  of ownership in the physical world—just as you own a car, you can own a digital asset. Move
  enforces ownership in such a way that once an asset is _moved_, the previous owner completely
  loses any control over it. This mechanism ensures a clear and secure change of ownership.

- **Non-copyable:** In the real world, unique items cannot be duplicated effortlessly. Move applies
  this principle to digital assets, ensuring they cannot be arbitrarily copied within the program.
  This property is crucial for maintaining the scarcity and uniqueness of digital assets, mirroring
  the intrinsic value of physical assets.

- **Non-discardable:** Just as you cannot accidentally lose a house or a car without a trace, Move
  ensures that no asset can be discarded or lost in a program. Instead, assets must be explicitly
  transferred or destroyed. This property guarantees the deliberate handling of digital assets,
  preventing accidental loss and ensuring accountability in asset management.

Move managed to encapsulate these properties in its design, becoming an ideal language for digital
assets.

## Summary

- Move was designed to provide a first-class abstraction for digital assets, enabling developers to
  create and manage assets natively.
- Essential properties of digital assets include ownership, non-copyability, and non-discardability,
  which Move enforces in its design.
- Move's asset model mirrors real-world asset management, ensuring secure and accountable asset
  ownership and transfer.

<!-- FILE: object/evolution-of-move.md -->

# Evolution of Move

While Move was created to manage digital assets, its initial storage model was bulky and not
well-suited for many use cases. For instance, if Alice wanted to transfer an asset X to Bob, Bob had
to create a new "empty" resource, and then Alice could transfer asset X to Bob. This process was not
intuitive and presented implementation challenges, partly due to the restrictive design of
[Diem](https://www.diem.com/en-us). Another drawback of the original design was the lack of built-in
support for a "transfer" operation, requiring every module to implement its own storage transfer
logic. Additionally, managing heterogeneous collections of assets in a single account was
particularly challenging.

Sui addressed these challenges by redesigning the storage and ownership model of objects to more
closely resemble real-world object interactions. With a native concept of ownership and _transfer_,
Alice can directly transfer asset X to Bob. Furthermore, Bob can maintain a collection of different
assets without any preparatory steps. These improvements laid the foundation for the Object Model in
Sui.

## Summary

- Move's initial storage model was not well-suited for managing digital assets, requiring complex
  and restrictive transfer operations.
- Sui introduced the Object Model, which provides a native concept of ownership, simplifying asset
  management and enabling heterogeneous collections.

# What is an Object?

The Object Model in Sui can be viewed as a high-level abstraction representing digital assets as
_objects_. These objects have their own type and associated behaviors, a unique identifier, and
support native storage operations like _transfer_ and _share_. Designed to be intuitive and easy to
use, the Object Model enables a wide range of use cases to be implemented with ease.

Objects in Sui have the following properties:

- **Type:** Every object has a type, defining the structure and behavior of the object. Objects of
  different types cannot be mixed or used interchangeably, ensuring objects are used correctly
  according to their type system.

- **Unique ID:** Each object has a unique identifier, distinguishing it from other objects. This ID
  is generated upon the object's creation and is immutable. It's used to track and identify objects
  within the system.

<!-- Note: consider "shared across many entities" -->

- **Owner:** Every object is associated with an owner, who has control over changes to the object.
  Ownership on Sui can be exclusive to an account, shared across the network, or frozen, allowing
  read-only access without modification or transfer capabilities. We will discuss ownership in more
  detail in the following sections.

  Note that ownership does not control the confidentiality of an object &mdash; it is always
  possible to read the contents of an on-chain object from outside of Move. You should never store
  unencrypted secrets inside of objects.

- **Data:** Objects encapsulate their data, simplifying management and manipulation. The data
  structure and operations are defined by the object's type.

- **Version:** The transition from accounts to objects is facilitated by object versioning.
  Traditionally, blockchains use a _nonce_ to prevent replay attacks. In Sui, the object's version
  acts as a nonce, preventing replay attacks for each object.

- **Digest:** Every object has a digest, which is a hash of the object's data. The digest is used to
  cryptographically verify the integrity of the object's data and ensures that it has not been
  tampered with. The digest is calculated when the object is created and is updated whenever the
  object's data changes.

## Summary

- Objects in Sui are high-level abstractions representing digital assets.
- Objects have a type, unique ID, owner, data, version, and digest.
- The Object Model simplifies asset management and enables a wide range of use cases.

<!-- FILE: object/ownership.md -->

# Ownership

Sui introduces four distinct ownership types for objects: single owner, shared state, immutable
shared state, and object-owner. Each model offers unique characteristics and suits different use
cases, enhancing flexibility and control in object management.

Note that ownership does not control the confidentiality of an object &mdash; it is always possible
to read the contents of an on-chain object from outside of Move. You should never store unencrypted
secrets inside of objects.

See the [Storage Functions](../storage/storage-functions.md) chapter for details on how to change
the owner or ownership type of an object.

## Account Owner (or Single Owner)

The account owner, also known as the _single owner_ model, is the foundational ownership type in
Sui. Here, an object is owned by a single account, granting that account exclusive control over the
object within the behaviors associated with its type. This model embodies the concept of _true
ownership_, where the account possesses complete authority over the object, making it inaccessible
to others for modification or transfer. This level of ownership clarity is a significant advantage
over other blockchain systems, where ownership definitions can be more ambiguous, and smart
contracts may have the ability to alter or transfer assets without the owner's consent.

Just like your private mobile phone, you own it, you can easily unlock and operate it, but others cannot.
Sui is designed to prevent things like cracking someone else's phone password (bypassing permission
checks to use objects that do not belong to others). Therefore, no one can use your assets unless
authorized by you.

## Shared State

Single owner model has its limitations: for example, it is very tricky to implement a marketplace
for digital assets without a shared state. For a generic marketplace scenario, imagine that Alice
owns an asset X, and she wants to sell it by putting it into a shared marketplace. Then Bob can come
and buy the asset directly from the marketplace. The reason why this is tricky is that it is
impossible to write a smart contract that would "lock" the asset in Alice's account and take it out
when Bob buys it. First, it will be a violation of the single owner model, and second, it requires a
shared access to the asset.

To facilitate a problem of shared data access, Sui has introduced a shared ownership model. In this
model, an object can be shared with the network. Shared objects can be read and modified by any
account on the network, and the rules of interaction are defined by the implementation of the
object. Typical uses for shared objects are: marketplaces, shared resources, escrows, and other
scenarios where multiple accounts need access to the same state.

## Immutable (Frozen) State

Sui also offers the _frozen object_ model, where an object becomes permanently read-only. These
immutable objects, while readable, cannot be modified or moved, providing a stable and constant
state accessible to all network participants. Frozen objects are ideal for public data, reference
materials, and other use cases where the state permanence is desirable.

## Object Owner

The last ownership model in Sui is the _object owner_. In this model, an object is owned by another
object. This feature allows creating complex relationships between objects, storing large
heterogeneous collections, and implementing extensible and modular systems. Practically speaking,
since the transactions are initiated by accounts, the transaction still accesses the parent object,
but it can then access the child objects through the parent object.

A use case we love to mention is a game character. Alice can own the Hero object from a game, and
the Hero can own items: also represented as objects, like a "Map", or a "Compass". Alice may take
the "Map" from the "Hero" object, and then send it to Bob, or sell it on a marketplace. With object
owner, it becomes very natural to imagine how the assets can be structured and managed in relation
to each other.

## Summary

- **Single Owner:** Objects are owned by a single account, granting exclusive control over the
  object.
- **Shared State:** Objects can be shared with the network, allowing multiple accounts to read and
  modify the object.
- **Immutable State:** Objects become permanently read-only, providing a stable and constant state.
- **Object Owner:** Objects can own other objects, enabling complex relationships and modular
  systems.

## Next Steps

In the next section we will talk about transaction execution paths in Sui, and how the ownership
models affect the transaction execution.


<!-- FILE: object/fast-path-and-consensus.md -->

# Fast Path & Consensus

The Object Model allows for variable transaction execution paths, depending on the object's
ownership type. The transaction execution path determines how the transaction is processed and
validated by the network. In this section, we'll explore the different transaction execution paths
in Sui and how they interact with the consensus mechanism.

## Concurrency Challenge

At its core, blockchain technology faces a fundamental concurrency challenge: multiple parties may
try to modify or access the same data simultaneously in a decentralized environment. This requires a
system for sequencing and validating transactions to support the network's consistency. Sui
addresses this challenge through a consensus mechanism, ensuring all nodes agree on the
transactions' sequence and state.

Consider a marketplace scenario where Alice and Bob simultaneously attempt to purchase the same
asset. The network must resolve this conflict to prevent double-spending, ensuring that at most one
transaction succeeds while the other is rightfully rejected.

## Fast Path

However, not all transactions require the same level of validation and consensus. For example, if
Alice wants to transfer an object that she owns to Bob, the network can process this transaction
without sequencing it with respect to all other transactions in the network, as only Alice has the
authority to access the object. This is known as the _fast path_ execution, where transactions
accessing account-owned objects are processed quickly without the need for extensive consensus. No
concurrent data access -> simpler challenge -> fast path.

Another ownership model that allows for fast path execution is the _immutable state_. Since
immutable objects cannot change, transactions involving them can be processed quickly without the
need to sequence them.

## Consensus Path

Transactions that do access shared state - on Sui it is represented with shared objects - require
sequencing to ensure that the state is updated and consistent across all nodes. This is known as the
execution through _consensus_, where transactions accessing shared objects are subject to the
agreement process to maintain network consistency.

<!-- On Sui consensus is per-object - mention!!! -->

## Objects owned by Objects

Lastly, it is important to mention that objects owned by other objects are subject to the same rules
as the parent object. If the parent object is _shared_, the child object is also transitively
shared. If the parent object is immutable, the child object is also immutable.

## Summary

- **Fast Path:** Transactions involving account-owned objects or immutable shared state are
  processed quickly without the need for extensive consensus.
- **Consensus Path:** Transactions involving shared objects require sequencing and consensus to
  ensure network integrity.
- **Objects owned by Objects:** Child objects inherit the ownership model of the parent object.

# Using Objects

In the [Object Model](./../object) chapter we briefly explained the evolution of the Move language
from an account-based model to an object-based model. In this chapter, we will dive deeper into the
object model and explore how to use objects in your Sui applications. If you haven't read the
[Object Model](./../object) chapter yet, we recommend you do so before continuing with this chapter.

<!-- Mention what Sui Verifier is! Bytecode level verification. -->


<!-- FILE: storage/key-ability.md -->

# The Key Ability

In the [Basic Syntax](./../move-basics) chapter we already covered two out of four abilities -
[Drop](./../move-basics/drop-ability) and [Copy](./../move-basics/copy-ability). They affect the
behavior of the value in a scope and are not directly related to storage. It is time to cover the
`key` ability, which allows the struct to be stored.

Historically, the `key` ability was created to mark the type as a _key in the storage_. A type with
the `key` ability could be stored at top-level in the storage, and could be _directly owned_ by an
account or address. With the introduction of the [Object Model](./../object), the `key` ability
naturally became the defining ability for the object.

<!-- TODO: What is Sui Verifier - link, later -->

## Object Definition

A struct with the `key` ability is considered an object and can be used in the storage functions.
The Sui Verifier will require the first field of the struct to be named `id` and have the type
`UID`.

```move
public struct Object has key {
    id: UID, // required
    name: String,
}

/// Creates a new Object with a Unique ID
public fun new(name: String, ctx: &mut TxContext): Object {
    Object {
        id: object::new(ctx), // creates a new UID
        name,
    }
}
```

A struct with the `key` ability is still a struct, and can have any number of fields and associated
functions. There is no special handling or syntax for packing, accessing or unpacking the struct.

However, because the first field of an object struct must be of type `UID` - a non-copyable and
non-droppable type (we will get to it very soon!), the struct transitively cannot have `drop` and
`copy` abilities. Thus, the object is non-discardable by design.

<!-- ## Asset Definition

In the context of the [Object Model](./../object/digital-assets), an object with the `key` ability can be considered an asset. It is non-discardable, unique, and can be *owned*.
 -->

## Types with the `key` Ability

Due to the `UID` requirement for types with `key`, none of the native types in Move can have the
`key` ability, nor can any of the [Standard Library](./../move-basics/standard-library) types. The
`key` ability is only present in the [Sui Framework](./../programmability/sui-framework) and custom
types.

## Next Steps

Key ability defines the object in Move, and objects are intended to be _stored_. In the next section
we present the `sui::transfer` module, which provides native storage functions for objects.

## Further Reading

- [Type Abilities](./../../reference/abilities) in the Move Reference.


<!-- FILE: storage/storage-functions.md -->

# Storage Functions

The module that defines main storage operations is `sui::transfer`. It is implicitly imported in all
packages that depend on the [Sui Framework](./../programmability/sui-framework), so, like other
implicitly imported modules (e.g. `std::option` or `std::vector`), it does not require adding a use
statement.

## Overview

The `transfer` module provides functions to perform all three storage operations matching
[ownership types](./../object/ownership) which we explained:

> On this page we will only talk about so-called _restricted_ storage operations, later we will
> cover _public_ ones, after the `store` ability is introduced.

1. _Transfer_ - send an object to an address, put it into _account owned_ state;
2. _Share_ - put an object into a _shared_ state, so it is available to everyone;
3. _Freeze_ - put an object into _immutable_ state, so it becomes a public constant and can never
   change.

The `transfer` module is a go-to for most of the storage operations, except a special case with
[Dynamic Fields](./../programmability/dynamic-fields) that awaits us in the next chapter.

## Ownership and References: a Quick Recap

In the [Ownership and Scope](./../move-basics/ownership-and-scope) and
[References](./../move-basics/references) chapters, we covered the basics of ownership and
references in Move. It is important that you understand these concepts when using storage functions.
Here is a quick recap of the most important points:

- The _move_ semantics in Move means that the value is _moved_ from one scope to another. In other
  words, if an instance of a type is passed to a function _by value_, it is _moved_ to the function
  scope and can't be accessed in the caller scope anymore.
- To maintain the ownership of the value, you can pass it _by reference_. Either by _immutable
  reference_ `&T` or _mutable reference_ `&mut T`. Then the value is _borrowed_ and can be accessed
  in the callee scope, however the owner stays the same.

```move
/// Moved by value
public fun take<T>(value: T) { /* value is moved here! */ abort 0 }

/// For immutable reference
public fun borrow<T>(value: &T) { /* value is borrowed here! can be read */ abort 0 }

/// For mutable reference
public fun borrow_mut<T>(value: &mut T) { /* value is mutably borrowed here! */ abort 0 }
```

<!-- TODO part on:
    - object does not have an associated storage type
    - the same type of object can be stored differently
    - the objects must be specified in the transaction by their ID
 -->

## Transfer

The `transfer::transfer` function is a public function used to transfer an object to another
address. Its signature is as follows, only accepts a type with the [`key` ability](./key-ability)
and an [address](./../move-basics/address) of the recipient. Please, note that the object is
passed into the function _by value_, therefore it is _moved_ to the function scope and then moved to
the recipient address:

```move
module sui::transfer;

public fun transfer<T: key>(obj: T, recipient: address);
```

In the next example, you can see how it can be used in a module that defines and sends an object to
the transaction sender.

```move
module book::transfer_to_sender;

/// A struct with `key` is an object. The first field is `id: UID`!
public struct AdminCap has key { id: UID }

/// `init` function is a special function that is called when the module
/// is published. It is a good place to create application objects.
fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    // Create a new `AdminCap` object, in this scope.
    let admin_cap = AdminCap { id: object::new(ctx) };

    // Transfer the object to the transaction sender.
    transfer::transfer(admin_cap, ctx.sender());

    // admin_cap is gone! Can't be accessed anymore.
}

/// Transfers the `AdminCap` object to the `recipient`. Thus, the recipient
/// becomes the owner of the object, and only they can access it.
public fun transfer_admin_cap(cap: AdminCap, recipient: address) {
    transfer::transfer(cap, recipient);
}
```

When the module is published, the `init` function will get called, and the `AdminCap` object which
we created there will be _transferred_ to the transaction sender. The `ctx.sender()` function
returns the sender address for the current transaction.

Once the `AdminCap` has been transferred to the sender, for example, to `0xa11ce`, the sender, and
only the sender, will be able to access the object. The object is now _account owned_.

> Account owned objects are a subject to _true ownership_ - only the account owner can access them.
> This is a fundamental concept in the Sui storage model.

Let's extend the example with a function that uses `AdminCap` to authorize a mint of a new object
and its transfer to another address:

```move
/// Some `Gift` object that the admin can `mint_and_transfer`.
public struct Gift has key { id: UID }

/// Creates a new `Gift` object and transfers it to the `recipient`.
public fun mint_and_transfer(
    _: &AdminCap, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext
) {
    let gift = Gift { id: object::new(ctx) };
    transfer::transfer(gift, recipient);
}
```

The `mint_and_transfer` function is a public function that "could" be called by anyone, but it
requires an `AdminCap` object to be passed as the first argument by reference. Without it, the
function will not be callable. This is a simple way to restrict access to privileged functions
called _[Capability](./../programmability/capability)_. Because the `AdminCap` object is _account
owned_, only `0xa11ce` will be able to call the `mint_and_transfer` function.

The `Gift`s sent to recipients will also be _account owned_, each gift being unique and owned
exclusively by the recipient.

A quick recap:

- `transfer` function is used to send an object to an address;
- The object becomes _account owned_ and can only be accessed by the recipient;
- Functions can be gated by requiring an object to be passed as an argument, creating a
  _capability_.

## Freeze

The `transfer::freeze_object` function is a public function that is used to put an object into an
_immutable_ state. Once an object is _frozen_, it can never be changed, and it can be accessed by
anyone by immutable reference.

The function signature is as follows, only accepts a type with the
[`key` ability](./key-ability). Just like all other storage functions, it takes the object _by
value_:

```move
module sui::transfer;

public fun freeze_object<T: key>(obj: T);
```

Let's expand on the previous example and add a function that allows the admin to create a `Config`
object and freeze it:

```move
/// Some `Config` object that the admin can `create_and_freeze`.
public struct Config has key {
    id: UID,
    message: String
}

/// Creates a new `Config` object and freezes it.
public fun create_and_freeze(
    _: &AdminCap,
    message: String,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
) {
    let config = Config {
        id: object::new(ctx),
        message
    };

    // Freeze the object so it becomes immutable.
    transfer::freeze_object(config);
}

/// Returns the message from the `Config` object.
/// Can access the object by immutable reference!
public fun message(c: &Config): String { c.message }
```

Config is an object that has a `message` field, and the `create_and_freeze` function creates a new
`Config` and freezes it. Once the object is frozen, it can be accessed by anyone by immutable
reference. The `message` function is a public function that returns the message from the `Config`
object. Config is now publicly available by its ID, and the message can be read by anyone.

> Function definitions are not connected to the object's state. It is possible to define a function
> that takes a mutable reference to an object that is used as frozen. However, it won't be callable
> on a frozen object.

The `message` function can be called on an immutable `Config` object, however, two functions below
are not callable on a frozen object:

```move
// === Functions below can't be called on a frozen object! ===

/// The function can be defined, but it won't be callable on a frozen object.
/// Only immutable references are allowed.
public fun message_mut(c: &mut Config): &mut String { &mut c.message }

/// Deletes the `Config` object, takes it by value.
/// Can't be called on a frozen object!
public fun delete_config(c: Config) {
    let Config { id, message: _ } = c;
    id.delete()
}
```

To summarize:

- `transfer::freeze_object` function is used to put an object into an _immutable_ state;
- Once an object is _frozen_, it can never be changed, deleted or transferred, and it can be
  accessed by anyone by immutable reference;

## Owned -> Frozen

Since the `transfer::freeze_object` signature accepts any type with the `key` ability, it can take
an object that was created in the same scope, but it can also take an object that was owned by an
account. This means that the `freeze_object` function can be used to _freeze_ an object that was
_transferred_ to the sender. For security concerns, we would not want to freeze the `AdminCap`
object - it would be a security risk to allow access to it to anyone. However, we can freeze the
`Gift` object that was minted and transferred to the recipient:

> Single Owner -> Immutable conversion is possible!

```move
/// Freezes the `Gift` object so it becomes immutable.
public fun freeze_gift(gift: Gift) {
    transfer::freeze_object(gift);
}
```

## Share

The `transfer::share_object` function is a public function used to put an object into a _shared_
state. Once an object is _shared_, it can be accessed by anyone by a mutable reference (hence,
immutable too). The function signature is as follows, only accepts a type with the
[`key` ability](./key-ability):

```move
module sui::transfer;

public fun share_object<T: key>(obj: T);
```

Once an object is _shared_, it is publicly available as a mutable reference.

## Special Case: Shared Object Deletion

While the shared object can't normally be taken by value, there is one special case where it can -
if the function that takes it deletes the object. This is a special case in the Sui storage model,
and it is used to allow the deletion of shared objects. To show how it works, we will create a
function that creates and shares a Config object and then another one that deletes it:

```move
/// Creates a new `Config` object and shares it.
public fun create_and_share(message: String, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    let config = Config {
        id: object::new(ctx),
        message
    };

    // Share the object so it becomes shared.
    transfer::share_object(config);
}
```

The `create_and_share` function creates a new `Config` object and shares it. The object is now
publicly available as a mutable reference. Let's create a function that deletes the shared object:

```move
/// Deletes the `Config` object, takes it by value.
/// Can be called on a shared object!
public fun delete_config(c: Config) {
    let Config { id, message: _ } = c;
    id.delete()
}
```

The `delete_config` function takes the `Config` object by value and deletes it, and the Sui Verifier
would allow this call. However, if the function returned the `Config` object back or attempted to
`freeze` or `transfer` it, the Sui Verifier would reject the transaction.

```move
// Won't work!
public fun transfer_shared(c: Config, to: address) {
    transfer::transfer(c, to);
}
```

To summarize:

- `share_object` function is used to put an object into a _shared_ state;
- Once an object is _shared_, it can be accessed by anyone by a mutable reference;
- Shared objects can be deleted, but they can't be transferred or frozen.

## Next Steps

Now that you know main features of the `transfer` module, you can start building more complex
applications on Sui that involve storage operations. In the next chapter, we will cover the
[Store Ability](./store-ability) which allows storing data inside objects and relaxes transfer
restrictions which we barely touched on here. And after that we will cover the
[UID and ID](./uid-and-id) types which are the most important types in the Sui storage model.


<!-- FILE: storage/store-ability.md -->

# Ability: Store

Now that you have an understanding of top-level storage functions which are enabled by the
[`key`](./key-ability) ability, we can talk about the last ability in the list - `store`.

## Definition

The `store` is a special ability that allows a type to be _stored_ in objects. This ability is
required for the type to be used as a field in a struct that has the `key` ability. Another way to
put it is that the `store` ability allows the value to be _wrapped_ in an object.

> The `store` ability also relaxes restrictions on transfer operations. We talk about it more in the
> [Restricted and Public Transfer](./transfer-restrictions) section.

## Example

In previous sections we already used types with the `key` ability: all objects must have a `UID`
field, which we used in examples; we also used the `Storable` type as a part of the `Config` struct.
The `Config` type also has the `store` ability.

```move
/// This type has the `store` ability.
public struct Storable has store {}

/// Config contains a `Storable` field which must have the `store` ability.
public struct Config has key, store {
    id: UID,
    stores: Storable,
}

/// MegaConfig contains a `Config` field which has the `store` ability.
public struct MegaConfig has key {
    id: UID,
    config: Config, // there it is!
}
```

## Types with the `store` Ability

All native types (except for references) in Move have the `store` ability. This includes:

- [bool](./../move-basics/primitive-types#booleans)
- [unsigned integers](./../move-basics/primitive-types#integer-types)
- [vector](./../move-basics/vector)
- [address](./../move-basics/address)

All of the types defined in the standard library have the `store` ability as well. This includes:

- [Option](./../move-basics/option)
- [String](./../move-basics/string)
- [TypeName](./../move-basics/type-reflection)

## Further Reading

<!-- FILE: storage/uid-and-id.md -->

# UID and ID

The `UID` type is defined in the `sui::object` module and is a wrapper around an `ID` which, in
turn, wraps the `address` type. The UIDs on Sui are guaranteed to be unique, and can't be reused
after the object was deleted.

```move
module sui::object;

/// UID is a unique identifier of an object
public struct UID has store {
    id: ID
}

/// ID is a wrapper around an address
public struct ID has store, drop {
    bytes: address
}
```

<!-- User doesn't know anything about TxContext yet... -->

## Fresh UID Generation:

- UID is derived from the `tx_hash` and an `index` which is incremented for each new UID.
- The `derive_id` function is implemented in the `sui::tx_context` module, and that is why TxContext
  is required for UID generation.
- Sui Verifier will not allow using a UID that wasn't created in the same function. That prevents
  UIDs from being pre-generated and reused after the object was unpacked.

New UID is created with the `object::new(ctx)` function. It takes a mutable reference to TxContext,
and returns a new UID.

```move
let ctx = &mut tx_context::dummy();
let uid = object::new(ctx);
```

On Sui, `UID` acts as a representation of an object, and allows defining behaviors and features of
an object. One of the key features - [Dynamic Fields](./../programmability/dynamic-fields) - is
possible because of the `UID` type being explicit. Additionally, it allows the
[Transfer to Object (TTO)](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/transfers/transfer-to-object), which we will
explain later in this chapter.

## UID Lifecycle

The `UID` type is created with the `object::new(ctx)` function, and it is destroyed with the
`object::delete(uid)` function. The `object::delete` consumes the UID _by value_, and it is
impossible to delete it unless the value was unpacked from an Object.

```move
let ctx = &mut tx_context::dummy();

let char = Character {
    id: object::new(ctx)
};

let Character { id } = char;
id.delete();
```

## Keeping the UID

The `UID` does not need to be deleted immediately after the object struct is unpacked. Sometimes it
may carry [Dynamic Fields](./../programmability/dynamic-fields) or objects transferred to it via
[Transfer To Object](./transfer-to-object). In such cases, the UID may be kept and stored in a
separate object.

## Proof of Deletion

The ability to return the UID of an object may be utilized in pattern called _proof of deletion_. It
is a rarely used technique, but it may be useful in some cases, for example, the creator or an
application may incentivize the deletion of an object by exchanging the deleted IDs for some reward.

In framework development this method could be used to ignore / bypass certain restrictions on
"taking" the object. If there's a container that enforces certain logic on transfers, like Kiosk
does, there could be a special scenario of skipping the checks by providing a proof of deletion.

This is one of the open topics for exploration and research, and it may be used in various ways.

## ID

When talking about `UID` we should also mention the `ID` type. It is a wrapper around the `address`
type, and is used to represent an address-pointer. Usually, `ID` is used to point at an object,
however, there's no restriction, and no guarantee that the `ID` points to an existing object.

> ID can be received as a transaction argument in a
> [Transaction Block](./../concepts/what-is-a-transaction). Alternatively, ID can be created from
> an `address` value using `to_id()` function.

<!--
```move

TODO: !!!!

```
-->

## fresh_object_address

TxContext provides the `fresh_object_address` function which can be utilized to create unique
addresses and `ID` - it may be useful in some application that assign unique identifiers to user
actions - for example, an order_id in a marketplace.


<!-- FILE: storage/transfer-restrictions.md -->

# Restricted and Public Transfer

Storage Operations that we described in the [previous sections](./storage-functions) are
restricted by default - they can only be called in the module defining the object. In other terms,
the type must be _internal_ to the module to be used in storage operations. This restriction is
implemented in the Sui Verifier and is enforced at the bytecode level.

However, to allow objects to be transferred and stored in other modules, these restrictions can be
relaxed. The `sui::transfer` module offers a set of _public\_\*_ functions that allow calling
storage operations in other modules. The functions are prefixed with `public_` and are available to
all modules and transactions.

## Public Storage Operations

The `sui::transfer` module provides the following public functions. They are almost identical to the
ones we already covered, but can be called from any module.

```move
module sui::transfer;

/// Public version of the `transfer` function.
public fun public_transfer<T: key + store>(object: T, to: address) {}

/// Public version of the `share_object` function.
public fun public_share_object<T: key + store>(object: T) {}

/// Public version of the `freeze_object` function.
public fun public_freeze_object<T: key + store>(object: T) {}
```

To illustrate the usage of these functions, consider the following example: module A defines an
ObjectK with `key` and ObjectKS with `key + store` abilities, and module B tries to implement a
`transfer` function for these objects.

> In this example we use `transfer::transfer`, but the behavior is identical for `share_object` and
> `freeze_object` functions.

```move
/// Defines `ObjectK` and `ObjectKS` with `key` and `key + store`
/// abilities respectively
module book::transfer_a;

public struct ObjectK has key { id: UID }
public struct ObjectKS has key, store { id: UID }
```

```move
/// Imports the `ObjectK` and `ObjectKS` types from `transfer_a` and attempts
/// to implement different `transfer` functions for them
module book::transfer_b;

// types are not internal to this module
use book::transfer_a::{ObjectK, ObjectKS};

// Fails! ObjectK is not `store`, and ObjectK is not internal to this module
public fun transfer_k(k: ObjectK, to: address) {
    transfer::transfer(k, to);
}

// Fails! ObjectKS has `store` but the function is not public
public fun transfer_ks(ks: ObjectKS, to: address) {
    transfer::transfer(ks, to);
}

// Fails! ObjectK is not `store`, `public_transfer` requires `store`
public fun public_transfer_k(k: ObjectK, to: address) {
    transfer::public_transfer(k, to);
}

// Works! ObjectKS has `store` and the function is public
public fun public_transfer_ks(ks: ObjectKS, to: address) {
    transfer::public_transfer(ks, to);
}
```

To expand on the example above:

- ❌ `transfer_k` fails because ObjectK is not internal to module `transfer_b`
- ❌ `transfer_ks` fails because ObjectKS is not internal to module `transfer_b`
- ❌ `public_transfer_k` fails because ObjectK does not have the `store` ability
- ✅ `public_transfer_ks` works because ObjectKS has the `store` ability and the transfer is public

## Implications of `store`

The decision on whether to add the `store` ability to a type should be made carefully. On one hand,
it is de-facto a requirement for the type to be _usable_ by other applications. On the other hand,
it allows _wrapping_ and changing the intended storage model. For example, a character may be
intended to be owned by accounts, but with the `store` ability it can be frozen (cannot be shared -
this transition is restricted).


<!-- FILE: programmability/index.md -->

# Advanced Programmability

In previous chapters we've covered [the basics of Move](./../move-basics) and
[Sui Storage Model](./../storage). Now it's time to dive deeper into the advanced topics of Sui
programmability.

This chapter introduces more complex concepts, practices and features of Move and Sui that are
essential for building more sophisticated applications. It is intended for developers who are
already familiar with the basics of Move and Sui, and are looking to expand their knowledge and
skills.


<!-- FILE: programmability/transaction-context.md -->

# Transaction Context

Every transaction has the execution context. The context is a set of predefined variables that are
available to the program during execution. For example, every transaction has a sender address, and
the transaction context contains a variable that holds the sender address.

The transaction context is available to the program through the `TxContext` struct. The struct is
defined in the [`sui::tx_context`][tx-context-framework] module and contains the following fields:

[tx-context-framework]: https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/sui/tx_context

```move
module sui::tx_context;

/// Information about the transaction currently being executed.
/// This cannot be constructed by a transaction--it is a privileged object created by
/// the VM and passed in to the entrypoint of the transaction as `&mut TxContext`.
public struct TxContext has drop {
    /// The address of the user that signed the current transaction
    sender: address,
    /// Hash of the current transaction
    tx_hash: vector<u8>,
    /// The current epoch number
    epoch: u64,
    /// Timestamp that the epoch started at
    epoch_timestamp_ms: u64,
    /// Counter recording the number of fresh id's created while executing
    /// this transaction. Always 0 at the start of a transaction
    ids_created: u64
}
```

Transaction context cannot be constructed manually or directly modified. It is created by the system
and passed to the function as a reference in a transaction. Any function called in a
[Transaction](./../concepts/what-is-a-transaction) has access to the context and can pass it into
the nested calls.

> `TxContext` has to be the last argument in the function signature.

## Reading the Transaction Context

With only exception of the `ids_created`, all of the fields in the `TxContext` have getters. The
getters are defined in the `sui::tx_context` module and are available to the program. The getters
don't require `&mut` because they don't modify the context.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/transaction-context.move anchor=reading

```

## Mutability

The `TxContext` is required to create new objects (or just `UID`s) in the system. New UIDs are
derived from the transaction digest, and for the digest to be unique, there needs to be a changing
parameter. Sui uses the `ids_created` field for that. Every time a new UID is created, the
`ids_created` field is incremented by one. This way, the digest is always unique.

Internally, it is represented as the `derive_id` function:

```move
native fun derive_id(tx_hash: vector<u8>, ids_created: u64): address;
```

## Generating Unique Addresses

The underlying `derive_id` function can also be utilized in your program to generate unique
addresses. The function itself is not exposed, but a wrapper function `fresh_object_address` is
available in the `sui::tx_context` module. It may be useful if you need to generate a unique
identifier in your program.

```move
module sui::tx_context;

/// Create an `address` that has not been used. As it is an object address, it will never
/// occur as the address for a user.
/// In other words, the generated address is a globally unique object ID.
public fun fresh_object_address(ctx: &mut TxContext): address {
    let ids_created = ctx.ids_created;
    let id = derive_id(*&ctx.tx_hash, ids_created);
    ctx.ids_created = ids_created + 1;
    id
}
```


<!-- FILE: programmability/module-initializer.md -->

# Module Initializer

A common use case in many applications is to run certain code just once when the package is
published. Imagine a simple store module that needs to create the main Store object upon its
publication. In Sui, this is achieved by defining an `init` function within the module. This
function will automatically be called when the module is published.

> All of the modules' `init` functions are called during the publishing process. Currently, this
> behavior is limited to the publish command and does not extend to package upgrades.
>
> <!-- [package upgrades]() -->

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/module-initializer.move anchor=main

```

In the same package, another module can have its own `init` function, encapsulating distinct logic.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/module-initializer-2.move anchor=other

```

## `init` Features

The function is called on publish, if it is present in the module and follows the rules:

- The function has to be named `init`, be private and have no return values.
- Takes one or two arguments: [One Time Witness](./one-time-witness) (optional) and
  [TxContext](./transaction-context). With `TxContext` always being the last argument.

```move
fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) { /* ... */}
fun init(otw: OTW, ctx: &mut TxContext) { /* ... */ }
```

TxContext can also be passed as immutable reference: `&TxContext`. However, practically speaking, it
should always be `&mut TxContext` since the `init` function can't access the on-chain state and to
create new objects it requires the mutable reference to the context.

```move
fun init(ctx: &TxContext) { /* ... */}
fun init(otw: OTW, ctx: &TxContext) { /* ... */ }
```

## Trust and Security

While `init` function can be used to create sensitive objects once, it is important to know that the
same object (e.g. `StoreOwnerCap` from the first example) can still be created in another function.
Especially given that new functions can be added to the module during an upgrade. So the `init`
function is a good place to set up the initial state of the module, but it is not a security measure
on its own.

There are ways to guarantee that the object was created only once, such as the
[One Time Witness](./one-time-witness). And there are ways to limit or disable the upgrade of the
module, which we will cover in the Package Upgrades chapter.

## Next Steps

As follows from the definition, the `init` function is guaranteed to be called only once when the
module is published. So it is a good place to put the code that initializes module's objects and
sets up the environment and configuration.

For example, if there's a [Capability](./capability) which is required for certain actions, it
should be created in the `init` function. In the next chapter we will talk about the `Capability`
pattern in more detail.


<!-- FILE: programmability/capability.md -->

# Pattern: Capability

In programming, a _capability_ is a token that gives the owner the right to perform a specific
action. It is a pattern that is used to control access to resources and operations. A simple example
of a capability is a key to a door. If you have the key, you can open the door. If you don't have
the key, you can't open the door. A more practical example is an Admin Capability which allows the
owner to perform administrative operations, which regular users cannot.

## Capability is an Object

In the [Sui Object Model](./../object/), capabilities are represented as objects. An owner of an
object can pass this object to a function to prove that they have the right to perform a specific
action. Due to strict typing, the function taking a capability as an argument can only be called
with the correct capability.

> There's a convention to name capabilities with the `Cap` suffix, for example, `AdminCap` or
> `KioskOwnerCap`.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/capability.move anchor=main

```

## Using `init` for Admin Capability

A very common practice is to create a single `AdminCap` object on package publish. This way, the
application can have a setup phase where the admin account prepares the state of the application.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/capability-2.move anchor=admin_cap

```

## Address Check vs Capability

Utilizing objects as capabilities is a relatively new concept in blockchain programming. And in
other smart-contract languages, authorization is often performed by checking the address of the
sender. This pattern is still viable on Sui, however, overall recommendation is to use capabilities
for better security, discoverability, and code organization.

Let's look at how the `new` function that creates a user would look like if it was using the address
check:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/capability-3.move anchor=with_address

```

And now, let's see how the same function would look like with the capability:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/capability-4.move anchor=with_capability

```

Using capabilities has several advantages over the address check:

- Migration of admin rights is easier with capabilities due to them being objects. In case of
  address, if the admin address changes, all the functions that check the address need to be
  updated - hence, require a package upgrade.
- Function signatures are more descriptive with capabilities. It is clear that the `new` function
  requires the `AdminCap` to be passed as an argument. And this function can't be called without it.
- Object Capabilities don't require extra checks in the function body, and hence, decrease the
  chance of a developer mistake.
- An owned Capability also serves in discovery. The owner of the AdminCap can see the object in
  their account (via a Wallet or Explorer), and know that they have the admin rights. This is less
  transparent with the address check.

However, the address approach has its own advantages. For example, if an address is multisig, and
transaction building gets more complex, it might be easier to check the address. Also, if there's a
central object of the application that is used in every function, it can store the admin address,
and this would simplify migration. The central object approach is also valuable for revocable
capabilities, where the admin can revoke the capability from the user.


<!-- FILE: programmability/epoch-and-time.md -->

# Epoch and Time

Sui has two ways of accessing the current time: `Epoch` and `Time`. The former represents
operational periods in the system and changed roughly every 24 hours. The latter represents the
current time in milliseconds since the Unix Epoch. Both can be accessed freely in the program.

## Epoch

Epochs are used to separate the system into operational periods. During an epoch the validator set
is fixed, however, at the epoch boundary, the validator set can be changed. Epochs play a crucial
role in the consensus algorithm and are used to determine the current validator set. They are also
used as measurement in the staking mechanism.

Epoch can be read from the [transaction context](./transaction-context):

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/epoch-and-time.move anchor=epoch

```

It is also possible to get the unix timestamp of the epoch start:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/epoch-and-time.move anchor=epoch_start

```

Normally, epochs are used in staking and system operations, however, in custom scenarios they can be
used to emulate 24h periods. They are critical if an application relies on the staking logic or
needs to know the current validator set.

## Time

For a more precise time measurement, Sui provides the `Clock` object. It is a system object that is
updated during checkpoints by the system, which stores the current time in milliseconds since the
Unix Epoch. The `Clock` object is defined in the `sui::clock` module and has a reserved address
`0x6`.

Clock is a shared object, but a transaction attempting to access it mutably will fail. This
limitation allows parallel access to the `Clock` object, which is important for maintaining
performance.

```move
module sui::clock;

/// Singleton shared object that exposes time to Move calls.  This
/// object is found at address 0x6, and can only be read (accessed
/// via an immutable reference) by entry functions.
///
/// Entry Functions that attempt to accept `Clock` by mutable
/// reference or value will fail to verify, and honest validators
/// will not sign or execute transactions that use `Clock` as an
/// input parameter, unless it is passed by immutable reference.
public struct Clock has key {
    id: UID,
    /// The clock's timestamp, which is set automatically by a
    /// system transaction every time consensus commits a
    /// schedule, or by `sui::clock::increment_for_testing` during
    /// testing.
    timestamp_ms: u64,
}
```

There is only one public function available in the `Clock` module - `timestamp_ms`. It returns the
current time in milliseconds since the Unix Epoch.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/epoch-and-time.move anchor=clock

```

## Testing

The `Clock` module provides a number of methods for use in testing.

# Collections

Collection types are a fundamental part of any programming language. They are used to store a
collection of data, such as a list of items. The `vector` type has already been covered in the
[vector section](./../move-basics/vector), and in this chapter we will cover the vector-based
collection types offered by the [Sui Framework](./sui-framework).

## Vector

While we have previously covered the `vector` type in the [vector section](./../move-basics/vector),
it is worth going over it again in a new context. This time we will cover the usage of the `vector`
type in objects and how it can be used in an application.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/collections.move anchor=vector

```

## VecSet

`VecSet` is a collection type that stores a set of unique items. It is similar to a `vector`, but it
does not allow duplicate items. This property makes it useful for storing a collection of unique
items, such as a list of IDs or addresses.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/collections-2.move anchor=vec_set

```

VecSet will fail on attempt to insert an item that already exists in the set.

## VecMap

`VecMap` is a collection type that stores a map of key-value pairs. It is similar to a `VecSet`, but
it allows you to associate a value with each item in the set. This makes it useful for storing a
collection of key-value pairs, such as a list of addresses and their balances, or a list of user IDs
and their associated data.

Keys in a `VecMap` are unique, and each key can only be associated with a single value. If you try
to insert a key-value pair with a key that already exists in the map, the old value will be replaced
with the new value.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/collections-3.move anchor=vec_map

```

## Limitations

Standard collection types are a great way to store typed data with guaranteed safety and
consistency. However, they are limited by the type of data they can store - the type system won't
allow you to store a wrong type in a collection; and they're limited in size - by the object size
limit. They will work for relatively small-sized sets and lists, but for larger collections you may
need to use a different approach.

Another limitations on collection types is inability to compare them. Because the order of insertion
is not guaranteed, an attempt to compare a `VecSet` to another `VecSet` may not yield the expected
results.

> This behavior is caught by the linter and will emit a warning: _Comparing collections of type
> 'sui::vec_set::VecSet' may yield unexpected result_

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/collections-4.move anchor=vec_set_comparison

```

In the example above, the comparison will fail because the order of insertion is not guaranteed, and
the two `VecSet` instances may have different orders of elements. And the comparison will fail even
if the two `VecSet` instances contain the same elements.

## Summary

- Vector is a native type that allows storing a list of items.
- VecSet is built on top of vector and allows storing sets of unique items.
- VecMap is used to store key-value pairs in a map-like structure.
- Vector-based collections are strictly typed and limited by the object size limit and are best
  suited for small-sized sets and lists.

## Next Steps

In the next section we will cover the [Wrapper Type Pattern](./wrapper-type-pattern) - a design
pattern often used with collection types to extend or restrict their behavior.


<!-- FILE: programmability/wrapper-type-pattern.md -->

# Pattern: Wrapper type

Sometimes, there’s a need to create a new type that behaves similarly to an existing type but with
certain modifications or restrictions. For example, you might want to create a
[collection type](./collections) that behaves like a vector but doesn’t allow modifying the elements
after they’ve been inserted. The wrapper type pattern is an effective way to achieve this.

## Definition

The wrapper type pattern is a design pattern in which you create a new type that wraps an existing
type. The wrapper type is distinct from the original but can be converted to and from it.

Often, it is implemented as a positional struct with a single field.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/wrapper-type-pattern.move anchor=main

```

## Common Practices

In cases where the goal is to extend the behavior of an existing type, it is common to provide
accessors for the wrapped type. This approach allows users to access the underlying type directly
when needed. For example, in the following code, we provide the `inner()`, `inner_mut()`, and
`into_inner()` methods for the Stack type.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/wrapper-type-pattern.move anchor=common

```

## Advantages

The wrapper type pattern offers several benefits:

- Custom Functions: It allows you to define custom functions for an existing type.
- Robust Function Signatures: It constrains function signatures to the new type, thereby making the
  code more robust.
- Improved Readability: It often increases the readability of the code by providing a more
  descriptive type name.

## Disadvantages

The wrapper type pattern is powerful in two scenarios—when you want to limit the behavior of an
existing type while providing a custom interface to the same data structure, and when you want to
extend the behavior of an existing type. However, it does have some limitations:

- Verbosity: It can be verbose to implement, especially if you want to expose all the methods of the
  wrapped type.
- Sparse Implementation: The implementation can be quite minimal, as it often just forwards calls to
  the wrapped type.

## Next Steps

The wrapper type pattern is very useful, particularly when used in conjunction with collection
types, as demonstrated in the previous section. In the next section, we will cover
[Dynamic Fields](./dynamic-fields) — an important primitive that enables
[Dynamic Collections](./dynamic-collections), a way to store large collections of data in a more
flexible, albeit more expensive, way.


<!-- FILE: programmability/dynamic-fields.md -->

# Dynamic Fields

Sui Object model allows objects to be attached to other objects as _dynamic fields_. The behavior is
similar to how a `Map` works in other programming languages. However, unlike a `Map` which in Move
would be strictly typed (we have covered it in the [Collections](./collections) section), dynamic
fields allow attaching objects of any type. A similar approach from the world of frontend
development would be a JavaScript Object type which allows storing any type of data dynamically.

> There's no limit to the number of dynamic fields that can be attached to an object. Thus, dynamic
> fields can be used to store large amounts of data that don't fit into the object limit size.

Dynamic Fields allow for a wide range of applications, from splitting data into smaller parts to
avoid [object size limit](./../guides/building-against-limits) to attaching objects as a part of
application logic.

## Definition

Dynamic Fields are defined in the `sui::dynamic_field` module of the
[Sui Framework](./sui-framework). They are attached to object's `UID` via a _name_, and can be
accessed using that name. There can be only one field with a given name attached to an object.

```move
module sui::dynamic_field;

/// Internal object used for storing the field and value
public struct Field<Name: copy + drop + store, Value: store> has key {
    /// Determined by the hash of the object ID, the field name
    /// value and it's type, i.e. hash(parent.id || name || Name)
    id: UID,
    /// The value for the name of this field
    name: Name,
    /// The value bound to this field
    value: Value,
}
```

As the definition shows, dynamic fields are stored in an internal `Field` object, which has the
`UID` generated in a deterministic way based on the object ID, the field name, and the field type.
The `Field` object contains the field name and the value bound to it. The constraints on the `Name`
and `Value` type parameters define the abilities that the key and value must have.

## Usage

The methods available for dynamic fields are straightforward: a field can be added with `add`,
removed with `remove`, and read with `borrow` and `borrow_mut`. Additionally, the `exists_` method
can be used to check if a field exists (for stricter checks with type, there is an
`exists_with_type` method).

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move anchor=usage

```

In the example above, we define a `Character` object and two different types of accessories that
could never be put together in a vector. However, dynamic fields allow us to store them together in
a single object. Both objects are attached to the `Character` via a `vector<u8>` (bytestring
literal), and can be accessed using their respective names.

As you can see, when we attached the accessories to the Character, we passed them _by value_. In
other words, both values were moved to a new scope, and their ownership was transferred to the
`Character` object. If we changed the ownership of `Character` object, the accessories would have
been moved with it.

And the last important property of dynamic fields we should highlight is that they are _accessed
through their parent_. This means that the `Hat` and `Mustache` objects are not directly accessible
and follow the same rules as the parent object.

## Foreign Types as Dynamic Fields

Dynamic fields allow objects to carry data of any type, including those defined in other modules.
This is possible due to their generic nature and relatively weak constraints on the type parameters.
Let's illustrate this by attaching a few different values to a `Character` object.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move anchor=foreign_types

```

In this example we showed how different types can be used for both _name_ and the _value_ of a
dynamic field. The `String` is attached via a `vector<u8>` name, the `u64` is attached via a `u32`
name, and the `bool` is attached via a `bool` name. Anything is possible with dynamic fields!

## Orphaned Dynamic Fields

> To prevent orphaned dynamic fields, please, use [Dynamic Collection Types](./dynamic-collections)
> such as `Bag` as they track the dynamic fields and won't allow unpacking if there are attached
> fields.

The `object::delete()` function, which is used to delete a UID, does not track the dynamic fields,
and cannot prevent dynamic fields from becoming orphaned. Once the parent UID is deleted, the
dynamic fields are not automatically deleted, and they become orphaned. This means that the dynamic
fields are still stored in the blockchain, but they will never become accessible again.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move anchor=orphan_fields

```

Orphaned objects are not a subject to storage rebate, and the storage fees will remain unclaimed.
One way to avoid orphaned dynamic fields during unpacking of an object is to return the `UID` and
store it somewhere temporarily until the dynamic fields are removed and handled properly.

## Custom Type as a Field Name

In the examples above, we used primitive types as field names since they have the required set of
abilities. But dynamic fields get even more interesting when we use custom types as field names.
This allows for a more structured way of storing data, and also allows for protecting the field
names from being accessed by other modules.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move anchor=custom_type

```

Two field names that we defined above are `AccessoryKey` and `MetadataKey`. The `AccessoryKey` has a
`String` field in it, hence it can be used multiple times with different `name` values. The
`MetadataKey` is an empty key, and can be attached only once.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move anchor=custom_type_usage

```

As you can see, custom types do work as field names but as long as they can be _constructed_ by the
module, in other words - if they are _internal_ to the module and defined in it. This limitation on
struct packing can open up new ways in the design of the application.

This approach is used in the Object Capability<!--[]](./object-capability)--> pattern, where an
application can authorize a foreign object to perform operations in it while not exposing the
capabilities to other modules.

## Exposing UID

<div class="warning">

Mutable access to `UID` is a security risk. Exposing `UID` of your type as a mutable reference can
lead to unwanted modifications or removal of the object's dynamic fields. Additionally, it affects
the Transfer to Object<!--[](./../storage/transfer-to-object)--> and
[Dynamic Object Fields](./dynamic-object-fields). Make sure to understand the implications before
exposing the `UID` as a mutable reference.

</div>

Because dynamic fields are attached to `UID`s, their usage in other modules depends on whether the
`UID` can be accessed. By default struct visibility protects the `id` field and won't let other
modules access it directly. However, if there's a public accessor method that returns a reference to
`UID`, dynamic fields can be read in other modules.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move anchor=exposed_uid

```

In the example above, we show how to expose the `UID` of a `Character` object. This solution may
work for some applications, however, it is important to remember that exposed `UID` allows reading
_any_ dynamic field attached to the object.

If you need to expose the `UID` only within the package, use a restrictive visibility, like
`public(package)`, or even better - use more specific accessor methods that would allow only reading
specific fields.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-fields.move anchor=exposed_uid_measures

```

## Dynamic Fields vs Fields

Dynamic Fields are more expensive than regular fields, as they require additional storage and costs
for accessing them. Their flexibility comes at a price, and it is important to understand the
implications when making a decision between using dynamic fields and regular fields.

## Limits

Dynamic Fields are not subject to the [object size limit](./../guides/building-against-limits), and
can be used to store large amounts of data. However, they are still subject to the
[dynamic fields created limit](./../guides/building-against-limits), which is set to 1000 fields per
transaction.

## Applications

Dynamic Fields can play a crucial role in applications of any complexity. They open up a variety of
different use cases, from storing heterogeneous data to attaching objects as part of the application
logic. They allow for certain [upgradeability practices](./../guides/upgradeability-practices) based
on the ability to define them _later_ and change the type of the field.

## Next Steps

In the next section we will cover [Dynamic Object Fields](./dynamic-object-fields) and explain how
they differ from dynamic fields, and what are the implications of using them.


<!-- FILE: programmability/dynamic-object-fields.md -->

# Dynamic Object Fields

> This section expands on the [Dynamic Fields](./dynamic-fields). Please, read it first to
> understand the basics of dynamic fields.

Another variation of dynamic fields is _dynamic object fields_, which have certain differences from
regular dynamic fields. In this section, we will cover the specifics of dynamic object fields and
explain how they differ from regular dynamic fields.

> General recommendation is to avoid using dynamic object fields in favor of (just) dynamic fields,
> especially if there's no need for direct discovery through the ID. The extra costs of dynamic
> object fields may not be justified by the benefits they provide.

## Definition

Dynamic Object Fields are defined in the `sui::dynamic_object_fields` module in the
[Sui Framework](./sui-framework). They are similar to dynamic fields in many ways, but unlike them,
dynamic object fields have an extra constraint on the `Value` type. The `Value` must have a
combination of `key` and `store`, not just `store` as in the case of dynamic fields.

They're less explicit in their framework definition, as the concept itself is more abstract:

```move
module sui::dynamic_object_field;

/// Internal object used for storing the field and the name associated with the
/// value. The separate type is necessary to prevent key collision with direct
/// usage of dynamic_field
public struct Wrapper<Name> has copy, drop, store {
    name: Name,
}
```

Unlike `Field` type in the [Dynamic Fields](./dynamic-fields#definition) section, the `Wrapper` type
only stores the name of the field. The value is the object itself, and is _not wrapped_.

The constraints on the `Value` type become visible in the methods available for dynamic object
fields. Here's the signature for the `add` function:

```move
/// Adds a dynamic object field to the object `object: &mut UID` at field
/// specified by `name: Name`. Aborts with `EFieldAlreadyExists` if the object
/// already has that field with that name.
public fun add<Name: copy + drop + store, Value: key + store>(
    // we use &mut UID in several spots for access control
    object: &mut UID,
    name: Name,
    value: Value,
) { /* implementation omitted */ }
```

The rest of the methods which are identical to the ones in the
[Dynamic Fields](./dynamic-fields#usage) section have the same constraints on the `Value` type.
Let's list them for reference:

- `add` - adds a dynamic object field to the object
- `remove` - removes a dynamic object field from the object
- `borrow` - borrows a dynamic object field from the object
- `borrow_mut` - borrows a mutable reference to a dynamic object field from the object
- `exists_` - checks if a dynamic object field exists
- `exists_with_type` - checks if a dynamic object field exists with a specific type

Additionally, there is an `id` method which returns the `ID` of the `Value` object without
specifying its type.

## Usage & Differences with Dynamic Fields

The main difference between dynamic fields and dynamic object fields is that the latter allows
storing _only objects_ as values. This means that you can't store primitive types like `u64` or
`bool`. It may be considered a limitation, if not for the fact that dynamic object fields are _not
wrapped_ into a separate object.

> The relaxed requirement for wrapping keeps the object available for off-chain discovery via its
> ID. However, this property may not be outstanding if wrapped object indexing is implemented,
> making the dynamic object fields a redundant feature.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-object-fields.move anchor=usage

```

## Pricing Differences

Dynamic Object Fields come a little more expensive than dynamic fields. Because of their internal
structure, they require 2 objects: the Wrapper for Name and the Value. Because of this, the cost of
adding and accessing object fields (loading 2 objects compared to 1 for dynamic fields) is higher.

## Next Steps

Both dynamic field and dynamic object fields are powerful features which allow for innovative
solutions in applications. However, they are relatively low-level and require careful handling to
avoid orphaned fields. In the next section, we will introduce a higher-level abstraction -
[Dynamic Collections](./dynamic-collections) - which can help with managing dynamic fields and
objects more effectively.


<!-- FILE: programmability/dynamic-collections.md -->

# Dynamic Collections

[Sui Framework](./sui-framework) offers a variety of collection types that build on the
[dynamic fields](./dynamic-fields) and [dynamic object fields](./dynamic-object-fields) concepts.
These collections are designed to be a safer and more understandable way to store and manage dynamic
fields and objects.

For each collection type we will specify the primitive they use, and the specific features they
offer.

> Unlike dynamic (object) fields which operate on UID, collection types have their own type and
> allow calling [associated functions](./../move-basics/struct-methods).

## Common Concepts

All of the collection types share the same set of methods, which are:

- `add` - adds a field to the collection
- `remove` - removes a field from the collection
- `borrow` - borrows a field from the collection
- `borrow_mut` - borrows a mutable reference to a field from the collection
- `contains` - checks if a field exists in the collection
- `length` - returns the number of fields in the collection
- `is_empty` - checks if the `length` is 0

All collection types support index syntax for `borrow` and `borrow_mut` methods. If you see square
brackets in the examples, they are translated into `borrow` and `borrow_mut` calls.

```move
let hat: &Hat = &bag[b"key"];
let hat_mut: &mut Hat = &mut bag[b"key"];

// is equivalent to
let hat: &Hat = bag.borrow(b"key");
let hat_mut: &mut Hat = bag.borrow_mut(b"key");
```

In the examples we won't focus on these functions, but rather on the differences between the
collection types.

## Bag

Bag, as the name suggests, acts as a "bag" of heterogeneous values. It is a simple, non-generic type
that can store any data. Bag will never allow orphaned fields, as it tracks the number of fields and
can't be destroyed if it's not empty.

```move
module sui::bag;

public struct Bag has key, store {
    /// the ID of this bag
    id: UID,
    /// the number of key-value pairs in the bag
    size: u64,
}
```

_See [full documentation for sui::bag][bag-framework] module._

Due to Bag storing any types, the extra methods it offers is:

- `contains_with_type` - checks if a field exists with a specific type

Used as a struct field:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-collections.move anchor=bag_struct

```

Using the Bag:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-collections.move anchor=bag_usage

```

## ObjectBag

Defined in the `sui::object_bag` module. Identical to [Bag](#bag), but uses
[dynamic object fields](./dynamic-object-fields) internally. Can only store objects as values.

_See [full documentation for sui::object_bag][object-bag-framework] module._

## Table

Table is a typed dynamic collection that has a fixed type for keys and values. It is defined in the
`sui::table` module.

```move
module sui::table;

public struct Table<phantom K: copy + drop + store, phantom V: store> has key, store {
    /// the ID of this table
    id: UID,
    /// the number of key-value pairs in the table
    size: u64,
}
```

_See [full documentation for sui::table][table-framework] module._

Used as a struct field:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-collections.move anchor=table_struct

```

Using the Table:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-collections.move anchor=table_usage

```

## ObjectTable

Defined in the `sui::object_table` module. Identical to [Table](#table), but uses
[dynamic object fields](./dynamic-object-fields) internally. Can only store objects as values.

_See [full documentation for sui::object_table][object-table-framework] module._

## LinkedTable

It is defined in the `sui::linked_table` module, similar to [Table](#table) but the values are linked together,
allowing for ordered insertion and removal.

```move
module sui::linked_table;

public struct LinkedTable<K: copy + drop + store, phantom V: store> has key, store {
    /// the ID of this table
    id: UID,
    /// the number of key-value pairs in the table
    size: u64,
    /// the front of the table, i.e. the key of the first entry
    head: Option<K>,
    /// the back of the table, i.e. the key of the last entry
    tail: Option<K>,
}
```

_See [full documentation for sui::linked_table][linked-table-framework] module._

Since the values stored in LinkedTable are linked together, it has unique methods for adding and deleting.

- `push_front` - inserts a key-value pair at the front of the table
- `push_back` - inserts a key-value pair at the back of the table
- `remove` - removes a key-value pair by key and returns the value
- `pop_front` - removes the front of the table, returns the key and value
- `pop_back` - removes the back of the table, returns the key and value

Used as a struct field:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-collections.move anchor=linked_table_struct

```

Using the LinkedTable:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/dynamic-collections.move anchor=linked_table_usage

```

## Summary

- [Bag](#bag) - a simple collection that can store any type of data.
- [ObjectBag](#objectbag) - a collection that can store only objects.
- [Table](#table) - a typed dynamic collection that has a fixed type for keys and values.
- [ObjectTable](#objecttable) - same as Table, but can only store objects.
- [LinkedTable](#linkedtable) - similar to Table but the values are linked together.

<!-- ## Choosing a Collection Type

Depending on the needs of your project, you may choose to -->


<!-- FILE: programmability/witness-pattern.md -->

# Pattern: Witness

Witness is a pattern of proving an existence by constructing a proof. In the context of programming,
witness is a way to prove a certain property of a system by providing a value that can only be
constructed if the property holds.

## Witness in Move

In the [Struct](./../move-basics/struct) section we have shown that a struct can only be created -
or _packed_ - by the module defining it. Hence, in Move, a module proves ownership of the type by
constructing it. This is one of the most important patterns in Move, and it is widely used for
generic type instantiation and authorization.

Practically speaking, for the witness to be used, there has to be a function that expects a witness
as an argument. In the example below it is the `new` function that expects a witness of the `T` type
to create a `Instance<T>` instance.

> It is often the case that the witness struct is not stored, and for that the function may require
> the [Drop](./../move-basics/drop-ability) ability for the type.

```move
module book::witness;

/// A struct that requires a witness to be created.
public struct Instance<T> { t: T }

/// Create a new instance of `Instance<T>` with the provided T.
public fun new<T>(witness: T): Instance<T> {
    Instance { t: witness }
}
```

The only way to construct an `Instance<T>` is to call the `new` function with an instance of the
type `T`. This is a basic example of the witness pattern in Move. A module providing a witness often
has a matching implementation, like the module `book::witness_source` below:

```move
module book::witness_source;

use book::witness::{Self, Instance};

/// A struct used as a witness.
public struct W {}

/// Create a new instance of `Instance<W>`.
public fun new_instance(): Instance<W> {
    witness::new(W {})
}
```

The instance of the struct `W` is passed into the `new_instance` function to create an
`Instance<W>`, thereby proving that the module `book::witness_source` owns the type `W`.

## Instantiating a Generic Type

Witness allows generic types to be instantiated with a concrete type. This is useful for inheriting
associated behaviors from the type with an option to extend them, if the module provides the ability
to do so.

```move
module sui::balance;

/// A Supply of T. Used for minting and burning.
public struct Supply<phantom T> has store {
    value: u64,
}

/// Create a new supply for type T with the provided witness.
public fun create_supply<T: drop>(_w: T): Supply<T> {
    Supply { value: 0 }
}

/// Get the `Supply` value.
public fun supply_value<T>(supply: &Supply<T>): u64 {
    supply.value
}
```

In the example above, which is borrowed from the [`balance` module][balance-framework] of the
[Sui Framework](./sui-framework), the `Supply` a generic struct that can be constructed only by
supplying a witness of the type `T`. The witness is taken by value and _discarded_ - hence the `T`
must have the [drop](./../move-basics/drop-ability) ability.

[balance-framework]: https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/sui/balance

The instantiated `Supply<T>` can then be used to mint new `Balance<T>`'s, where `T` is the type of
the supply.

```move
module sui::balance;

/// Storable balance.
public struct Balance<phantom T> has store {
    value: u64,
}

/// Increase supply by `value` and create a new `Balance<T>` with this value.
public fun increase_supply<T>(self: &mut Supply<T>, value: u64): Balance<T> {
    assert!(value < (18446744073709551615u64 - self.value), EOverflow);
    self.value = self.value + value;
    Balance { value }
}
```

## One Time Witness

While a struct can be created any number of times, there are cases where a struct should be
guaranteed to be created only once. For this purpose, Sui provides the "One-Time Witness" - a
special witness that can only be used once. We explain it in more detail in the
[next section](./one-time-witness).

## Summary

- Witness is a pattern of proving a certain property by constructing a proof.
- In Move, a module proves ownership of a type by constructing it.
- Witness is often used for generic type instantiation and authorization.

## Next Steps

In the next section, we will learn about the [One Time Witness](./one-time-witness) pattern.

# One Time Witness

While regular [Witness](./witness-pattern) is a great way to statically prove the ownership of a
type, there are cases where we need to ensure that a Witness is instantiated only once. And this is
the purpose of the One Time Witness (OTW).

<!--
Notes to self:
  - background first or definition first - which one is better?
  - why would someone read this section?
  - if we removed the OTW from docs, then we should give definition first.
-->

## Definition

The OTW is a special type of Witness that can be used only once. It cannot be manually created and
it is guaranteed to be unique per module. Sui Adapter treats a type as an OTW if it follows these
rules:

1. Has only `drop` ability.
2. Has no fields.
3. Is not a generic type.
4. Named after the module with all uppercase letters.

Here is an example of an OTW:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/one-time-witness.move anchor=definition

```

The OTW cannot be constructed manually, and any code attempting to do so will result in a
compilation error. The OTW can be received as the first argument in the
[module initializer](./module-initializer). And because the `init` function is called only once per
module, the OTW is guaranteed to be instantiated only once.

## Enforcing the OTW

To check if a type is an OTW, `sui::types` module of the [Sui Framework](./sui-framework) offers a
special function `is_one_time_witness` that can be used to check if the type is an OTW.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/one-time-witness.move anchor=usage

```

<!-- ## Background

Before we get to actual definition of the OTW, let's consider a simple example. We want to build a generic implementation of a Coin type, which can be initialized with a witness. A instance of a witness `T` is used to create a new `TreasuryCap<T>` which is then used to mint a new `Coin<T>`.

```move
module book::simple_coin {

    /// Controls the supply of the Coin.
    public struct TreasuryCap<phantom T> has key, store {
        id: UID,
        total_supply: u64,
    }

    /// The Coin type where the `T` is a witness.
    public struct Coin<phantom T> has key, store {
        id: UID,
        value: u64,
    }

    /// Create a new TreasuryCap with a witness.
    /// Vulnerable: we can create multiple TreasuryCap<T> with the same witness.
    public fun new<T: drop>(_: T, ctx: &mut TxContext): TreasuryCap<T> {
        TreasuryCap { id: object::new(ctx), total_supply: 0 }
    }

    /// We use a regular witness to authorize the minting.
    public fun mint<T>(
        treasury: &mut TreasuryCap<T>,
        value: u64,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        treasury.total_supply = treasury.total_supply + value;
        Coin { id: object::new(ctx), value }
    }
}
```

A dishonest developer would be able to create multiple `TreasuryCap`s with the same witness, and mint more `Coin`s than expected. Here is an example of such a malicious module:

```move
module book::simple_coin_cheater {
    /// The Coin witness.
    public struct Move has drop {}

    /// Initialize the TreasuryCap with the Move witness.
    /// ...and do it twice! >_<
    fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let treasury_cap = book::simple_coin::new(Move {}, ctx);
        let secret_treasury = book::simple_coin::new(Move {}, ctx);

        transfer::public_transfer(treasury_cap, ctx.sender())
        transfer::public_transfer(secret_treasury, ctx.sender())
    }
}

```

The example above has no protection against issuing multiple `TreasuryCap`s with the same witness, and in real-world application, this creates a problem of trust. If it was a human decision to support a Coin based on this implementation, they would have to make sure that:

- there is only one `TreasuryCap` for a given `T`.
- the module cannot be upgraded to issue more `TreasuryCap`s.
- the module code does not contain any backdoors to issue more `TreasuryCap`s.

However, it is not possible to check any of these conditions inside the Move code. And to prevent the need for trust, Sui introduces the OTW pattern.

## Solving the Coin Problem

To solve the case of multiple `TreasuryCap`s, we can use the OTW pattern. By defining the `COIN_OTW` type as an OTW, we can ensure that the `COIN_OTW` is used only once. The `COIN_OTW` is then used to create a new `TreasuryCap` and mint a new `Coin`.

```move

With

```move
module book::coin_otw {

    /// The OTW for the `book::coin_otw` module.
    struct COIN_OTW has drop {}

    /// Receive the instance of `COIN_OTW` as the first argument.
    fun init(otw: COIN_OTW, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let treasury_cap = book::simple_coin::new(COIN_OTW {}, ctx);
        transfer::public_transfer(treasury_cap, ctx.sender())
    }
}
```


 -->

<!-- ## Case Study: Coin

TODO: add a story behind TreasuryCap and Coin

-->

## Summary

The OTW pattern is a great way to ensure that a type is used only once. Most of the developers
should understand how to define and receive the OTW, while the OTW checks and enforcement is mostly
needed in libraries and frameworks. For example, the `sui::coin` module requires an OTW in the
`coin::create_currency` method, therefore enforcing that the `coin::TreasuryCap` is created only
once.

OTW is a powerful tool that lays the foundation for the [Publisher](./publisher) object, which we
will cover in the next section.

<!--

## Questions
- What other ways could be used to prevent multiple `TreasuryCap`s?
- Are there any other ways to use the OTW?

# Publisher Authority

In application design and development, it is often needed to prove publisher authority. This is
especially important in the context of digital assets, where the publisher may enable or disable
certain features for their assets. The Publisher Object is an object, defined in the
[Sui Framework](./sui-framework), that allows the publisher to prove their _authority over a type_.

## Definition

The Publisher object is defined in the `sui::package` module of the Sui Framework. It is a very
simple, non-generic object that can be initialized once per module (and multiple times per package)
and is used to prove the authority of the publisher over a type. To claim a Publisher object, the
publisher must present a [One Time Witness](./one-time-witness) to the `package::claim` function.

```move
module sui::package;

public struct Publisher has key, store {
    id: UID,
    package: String,
    module_name: String,
}
```

> If you're not familiar with the One Time Witness, you can read more about it
> [here](./one-time-witness).

Here's a simple example of claiming a `Publisher` object in a module:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/publisher.move anchor=publisher

```

## Usage

The Publisher object has two functions associated with it which are used to prove the publisher's
authority over a type:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/publisher.move anchor=use_publisher

```

## Publisher as Admin Role

For small applications or simple use cases, the Publisher object can be used as an admin
[capability](./capability). While in the broader context, the Publisher object has control over
system configurations, it can also be used to manage the application's state.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/publisher.move anchor=publisher_as_admin

```

However, Publisher misses some native properties of [Capabilities](./capability), such as type
safety and expressiveness. The signature for the `admin_action` is not very explicit, can be called
by anyone else. And due to `Publisher` object being standard, there now is a risk of unauthorized
access if the `from_module` check is not performed. So it's important to be cautious when using the
`Publisher` object as an admin role.

## Role on Sui

Publisher is required for certain features on Sui. [Object Display](./display) can be created only
by the Publisher, and TransferPolicy - an important component of the Kiosk system - also requires
the Publisher object to prove ownership of the type.

## Next Steps

In the next chapter we will cover the first feature that requires the Publisher object - Object
Display - a way to describe objects for clients, and standardize metadata. A must-have for
user-friendly applications.


<!-- FILE: programmability/events.md -->

# Events

Events are a way to notify off-chain listeners about on-chain events. They are used to emit
additional information about the transaction that is not stored - and, hence, can't be accessed -
on-chain. Events are emitted by the `sui::event` module located in the
[Sui Framework](./sui-framework).

> Any custom type with the [copy](./../move-basics/copy-ability) and
> [drop](./../move-basics/drop-ability) abilities can be emitted as an event. Sui Verifier requires
> the type to be internal to the module.

```move
module sui::event;

/// Emit a custom Move event, sending the data off-chain.
///
/// Used for creating custom indexes and tracking on-chain
/// activity in a way that suits a specific application the most.
///
/// The type `T` is the main way to index the event, and can contain
/// phantom parameters, eg `emit(MyEvent<phantom T>)`.
public native fun emit<T: copy + drop>(event: T);
```

## Emitting Events

Events are emitted using the `emit` function in the `sui::event` module. The function takes a single
argument - the event to be emitted. The event data is passed by value,

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/events.move anchor=emit

```

The Sui Verifier requires the type passed to the `emit` function to be _internal to the module_. So
emitting a type from another module will result in a compilation error. Primitive types, although
they match the _copy_ and _drop_ requirement, are not allowed to be emitted as events.

## Event Structure

Events are a part of the transaction result and are stored in the _transaction effects_. As such,
they natively have the `sender` field which is the address who sent the transaction. So adding a
"sender" field to the event is not necessary. Similarly, event metadata contains the timestamp. But
it is important to note that the timestamp is relative to the node and may vary a little from node
to node.

# Sui Framework

Sui Framework is a default dependency set in the [Package Manifest](./../concepts/manifest). It
depends on the [Standard Library](./../move-basics/standard-library) and provides Sui-specific
features, including the interaction with the storage, and Sui-specific native types and modules.

_For convenience, we grouped the modules in the Sui Framework into multiple categories. But they're
still part of the same framework._

# Pattern: Hot Potato

A case in the abilities system - a struct without any abilities - is called _hot potato_. It cannot
be stored (not as [an object](./../storage/key-ability) nor as
[a field in another struct](./../storage/store-ability)), it cannot be
[copied](./../move-basics/copy-ability) or [discarded](./../move-basics/drop-ability). Hence, once
constructed, it must be gracefully [unpacked by its module](./../move-basics/struct), or the
transaction will abort due to unused value without drop.

> If you're familiar with languages that support _callbacks_, you can think of a hot potato as an
> obligation to call a callback function. If you don't call it, the transaction will abort.

The name comes from the children's game where a ball is passed quickly between players, and none of
the players want to be the last one holding it when the music stops, or they are out of the game.
This is the best illustration of the pattern - the instance of a hot-potato struct is passed between
calls, and none of the modules can keep it.

## Defining a Hot Potato

A hot potato can be any struct with no abilities. For example, the following struct is a hot potato:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/hot-potato-pattern.move anchor=definition

```

Because the `Request` has no abilities and cannot be stored or ignored, the module must provide a
function to unpack it. For example:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/hot-potato-pattern.move anchor=new_request

```

## Example Usage

In the following example, the `Promise` hot potato is used to ensure that the borrowed value, when
taken from the container, is returned back to it. The `Promise` struct contains the ID of the
borrowed object, and the ID of the container, ensuring that the borrowed value was not swapped for
another and is returned to the correct container.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/hot-potato-pattern.move anchor=container_borrow

```

## Applications

Below we list some of the common use cases for the hot potato pattern.

### Borrowing

As shown in the [example above](#example-usage), the hot potato is very effective for borrowing with
a guarantee that the borrowed value is returned to the correct container. While the example focuses
on a value stored inside an `Option`, the same pattern can be applied to any other storage type, say
a [dynamic field](./dynamic-fields).

### Flash Loans

Canonical example of the hot potato pattern is flash loans. A flash loan is a loan that is borrowed
and repaid in the same transaction. The borrowed funds are used to perform some operations, and the
repaid funds are returned to the lender. The hot potato pattern ensures that the borrowed funds are
returned to the lender.

An example usage of this pattern may look like this:

```move
// Borrow the funds from the lender.
let (asset_a, potato) = lender.borrow(amount);

// Perform some operations with the borrowed funds.
let asset_b = dex.trade(loan);
let proceeds = another_contract::do_something(asset_b);

// Keep the commission and return the rest to the lender.
let pay_back = proceeds.split(amount, ctx);
lender.repay(pay_back, potato);
transfer::public_transfer(proceeds, ctx.sender());
```

### Variable-path Execution

The hot potato pattern can be used to introduce variation in the execution path. For example, if
there is a module which allows purchasing a `Phone` for some "Bonus Points" or for USD, the hot
potato can be used to decouple the purchase from the payment. The approach is very similar to how
some shops work - you take the item from the shelf, and then you go to the cashier to pay for it.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/hot-potato-pattern.move anchor=phone_shop

```

This decoupling technique allows separating the purchase logic from the payment logic, making the
code more modular and easier to maintain. The `Ticket` could be split into its own module, providing
a basic interface for the payment, and the shop implementation could be extended to support other
goods without changing the payment logic.

### Compositional Patterns

Hot potato can be used to link together different modules in a compositional way. Its module may
define ways to interact with the hot potato, for example, stamp it with a type signature, or to
extract some information from it. This way, the hot potato can be passed between different modules,
and even different packages within the same transaction.

<!-- TODO: add [Request Pattern](./request-pattern) -->

The most important compositional pattern is the Request Pattern, which we will cover in the next
section.

### Usage in the Sui Framework

The pattern is used in various forms in the Sui Framework. Here are some examples:

- [sui::borrow][borrow-framework] - uses hot potato to ensure that the borrowed value is returned to
  the correct container.
- [sui::transfer_policy][transfer-policy-framework] - defines a `TransferRequest` - a hot potato
  which can only be consumed if all conditions are met.
- [sui::token][token-framework] - in the Closed Loop Token system, an `ActionRequest` carries the
  information about the performed action and collects approvals similarly to `TransferRequest`.

[borrow-framework]: https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/sui-framework/borrow
[transfer-policy-framework]: https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/sui-framework/transfer_policy
[token-framework]: https://docs.sui.io/references/framework/sui-framework/token

## Summary

- A hot potato is a struct without abilities, it must come with a way to create and destroy it.
- Hot potatoes are used to ensure that some action is taken before the transaction ends, similar to
  a callback.
- Most common use cases for hot potato are borrowing, flash loans, variable-path execution, and
  compositional patterns.

# Binary Canonical Serialization

Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS) is a binary encoding format for structured data. It was
originally designed in Diem, and became the standard serialization format for Move. BCS is simple,
efficient, deterministic, and easy to implement in any programming language.

> The full format specification is available in the
> [BCS repository](https://github.com/zefchain/bcs).

## Format

BCS is a binary format that supports unsigned integers up to 256 bits, options, booleans, unit
(empty value), fixed and variable-length sequences, and maps. The format is designed to be
deterministic, meaning that the same data will always be serialized to the same bytes.

> "BCS is not a self-describing format. As such, in order to deserialize a message, one must know
> the message type and layout ahead of time" from the [README](https://github.com/zefchain/bcs)

Integers are stored in little-endian format, and variable-length integers are encoded using a
variable-length encoding scheme. Sequences are prefixed with their length as ULEB128, enumerations
are stored as the index of the variant followed by the data, and maps are stored as an ordered
sequence of key-value pairs.

Structs are treated as a sequence of fields, and the fields are serialized in the order they are
defined in the struct. The fields are serialized using the same rules as the top-level data.

## Using BCS

The [Sui Framework](./sui-framework) includes the sui::bcs module for encoding and decoding data.
Encoding functions are native to the VM, and decoding functions are implemented in Move.

## Encoding

To encode data, use the `bcs::to_bytes` function, which converts data references into byte vectors.
This function supports encoding any types, including structs.

```move
module std::bcs;

public native fun to_bytes<T>(t: &T): vector<u8>;
```

The following example shows how to encode a struct using BCS. The `to_bytes` function can take any
value and encode it as a vector of bytes.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/bcs.move anchor=encode

```

### Encoding a Struct

Structs encode similarly to simple types. Here is how to encode a struct using BCS:

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/bcs.move anchor=encode_struct

```

## Decoding

Because BCS does not self-describe and Move is statically typed, decoding requires prior knowledge
of the data type. The `sui::bcs` module provides various functions to assist with this process.

### Wrapper API

BCS is implemented as a wrapper in Move. The decoder takes the bytes by value, and then allows the
caller to _peel off_ the data by calling different decoding functions, prefixed with `peel_*`. The
data is split off the bytes, and the remainder bytes are kept in the wrapper until the
`into_remainder_bytes` function is called.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/bcs.move anchor=decode

```

There is a common practice to use multiple variables in a single `let` statement during decoding. It
makes code a little bit more readable and helps to avoid unnecessary copying of the data.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/bcs.move anchor=chain_decode

```

### Decoding Vectors

While most of the primitive types have a dedicated decoding function, vectors need special handling,
which depends on the type of the elements. For vectors, first you need to decode the length of the
vector, and then decode each element in a loop.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/bcs.move anchor=decode_vector

```

For most common scenarios, `bcs` module provides a basic set of functions for decoding vectors:

- `peel_vec_address(): vector<address>`
- `peel_vec_bool(): vector<bool>`
- `peel_vec_u8(): vector<u8>`
- `peel_vec_u64(): vector<u64>`
- `peel_vec_u128(): vector<u128>`
- `peel_vec_vec_u8(): vector<vector<u8>>` - vector of byte vectors

### Decoding Option

<!--
> Coincidentally, Option, being a vector in Move, overlaps with the representation of an enum with a
> single variant in BCS, and makes Option in Rust fully compatible with the one in Move.
-->

[Option](./../move-basics/option) is represented as a vector of either 0 or 1 element. To read an
option, you would treat it like a vector and check its length (first byte - either 1 or 0).

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/bcs.move anchor=decode_option

```

> If you need to decode an option of a custom type, use the method in the code snippet above.

The most common scenarios, `bcs` module provides a basic set of functions for decoding Option's:

- `peel_option_address(): Option<address>`
- `peel_option_bool(): Option<bool>`
- `peel_option_u8(): Option<u8>`
- `peel_option_u64(): Option<u64>`
- `peel_option_u128(): Option<u128>`

### Decoding Structs

Structs are decoded field by field, and there is no standard function to automatically decode bytes
into a Move struct, and it would have been a violation of the Move's type system. Instead, you need
to decode each field manually.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/bcs.move anchor=decode_struct

```

## Summary

Binary Canonical Serialization is an efficient binary format for structured data, ensuring
consistent serialization across platforms. The Sui Framework provides comprehensive tools for
working with BCS, allowing extensive functionality through built-in functions.

# Move 2024 Migration Guide

Move 2024 is the new edition of the Move language that is maintained by Mysten Labs. This guide is
intended to help you understand the differences between the 2024 edition and the previous version of
the Move language.

> This guide provides a high-level overview of the changes in the new edition. For a more detailed
> and exhaustive list of changes, refer to the
> [Sui Documentation](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/advanced/move-2024-migration).

## Using the New Edition

To use the new edition, you need to specify the edition in the `move` file. The edition is specified
in the `move` file using the `edition` keyword. Currently, the only available edition is
`2024.beta`.

```ini
edition = "2024"
# alternatively, for new features:
edition = "2024.beta"
```

## Migration Tool

The Move CLI has a migration tool that updates the code to the new edition. To use the migration
tool, run the following command:

```bash
$ sui move migrate
```

The migration tool will update the code to use the `let mut` syntax, the new `public` modifier for
structs, and the `public(package)` function visibility instead of `friend` declarations.

## Mutable Bindings with `let mut`

Move 2024 introduces `let mut` syntax to declare mutable variables. The `let mut` syntax is used to
declare a mutable variable that can be changed after it is declared.

> `let mut` declaration is now required for mutable variables. Compiler will emit an error if you
> try to reassign a variable without the `mut` keyword.

```move
// Move 2020
let x: u64 = 10;
x = 20;

// Move 2024
let mut x: u64 = 10;
x = 20;
```

Additionally, the `mut` keyword is used in tuple destructuring and function arguments to declare
mutable variables.

```move
// takes by value and mutates
fun takes_by_value_and_mutates(mut v: Value): Value {
    v.field = 10;
    v
}

// `mut` should be placed before the variable name
fun destruct() {
    let (x, y) = point::get_point();
    let (mut x, y) = point::get_point();
    let (mut x, mut y) = point::get_point();
}

// in struct unpack
fun unpack() {
    let Point { x, mut y } = point::get_point();
    let Point { mut x, mut y } = point::get_point();
}
```

## Friends are Deprecated

In Move 2024, the `friend` keyword is deprecated. Instead, you can use the `public(package)`
visibility modifier to make functions visible to other modules in the same package.

```move
// Move 2020
friend book::friend_module;
public(friend) fun protected_function() {}

// Move 2024
public(package) fun protected_function_2024() {}
```

## Struct Visibility

In Move 2024, structs get a visibility modifier. Currently, the only available visibility modifier
is `public`.

```move
// Move 2020
struct Book {}

// Move 2024
public struct Book {}
```

## Method Syntax

In the new edition, functions which have a struct as the first argument are associated with the
struct. This means that the function can be called using the dot notation. Methods defined in the
same module with the type are automatically exported.

> Methods are automatically exported if the type is defined in the same module as the method. It is
> impossible to export methods for types defined in other modules. However, you can create
> [custom aliases](#method-aliases) for methods in the module scope.

```move
public fun count(c: &Counter): u64 { /* ... */ }

fun use_counter() {
    // move 2020
    let count = counter::count(&c);

    // move 2024
    let count = c.count();
}
```

## Methods for Built-in Types

In Move 2024, some of the native and standard types received associated methods. For example, the
`vector` type has a `to_string` method that converts the vector into a UTF8 string.

```move
fun aliases() {
    // vector to string and ascii string
    let str: String = b"Hello, World!".to_string();
    let ascii: ascii::String = b"Hello, World!".to_ascii_string();

    // address to bytes
    let bytes = @0xa11ce.to_bytes();
}
```

For the full list of built-in aliases, refer to the
[Standard Library](./../move-basics/standard-library#source-code) and
[Sui Framework](./../programmability/sui-framework#source-code) source code.

## Borrowing Operator

Some of the built-in types support borrowing operators. The borrowing operator is used to get a
reference to the element at the specified index. The borrowing operator is defined as `[]`.

```move
fun play_vec() {
    let v = vector[1,2,3,4];
    let first = &v[0];         // calls vector::borrow(v, 0)
    let first_mut = &mut v[0]; // calls vector::borrow_mut(v, 0)
    let first_copy = v[0];     // calls *vector::borrow(v, 0)
}
```

Types that support the borrowing operator are:

- `vector`
- `sui::vec_map::VecMap`
- `sui::table::Table`
- `sui::bag::Bag`
- `sui::object_table::ObjectTable`
- `sui::object_bag::ObjectBag`
- `sui::linked_table::LinkedTable`

To implement the borrowing operator for a custom type, you need to add a `#[syntax(index)]`
attribute to the methods.

```move
#[syntax(index)]
public fun borrow(c: &List<T>, key: String): &T { /* ... */ }

#[syntax(index)]
public fun borrow_mut(c: &mut List<T>, key: String): &mut T { /* ... */ }
```

## Method Aliases

In Move 2024, methods can be associated with types. The alias can be defined for any type locally to
the module; or publicly, if the type is defined in the same module.

```move
// my_module.move
// Local: type is foreign to the module
use fun my_custom_function as vector.do_magic;

// sui-framework/kiosk/kiosk.move
// Exported: type is defined in the same module
public use fun kiosk_owner_cap_for as KioskOwnerCap.kiosk;
```

<!-- ## Macros

Macros are introduced in Move 2024. And `assert!` is no longer a built-in function - Instead, it's a macro.

```move
// can be called as for!(0, 10, |i| call(i));
macro fun for($start: u64, $stop: u64, $body: |u64|) {
    let mut i = $start;
    let stop = $stop;
    while (i < stop) {
        $body(i);
        i = i + 1
    }
}
```
 -->


<!-- FILE: guides/upgradeability-practices.md -->

# Upgradeability Practices

To talk about best practices for upgradeability, we need to first understand what can be upgraded in
a package. The base premise of upgradeability is that an upgrade should not break public
compatibility with the previous version. The parts of the module which can be used in dependent
packages should not change their static signature. This applies to modules - a module can not be
removed from a package, public structs - they can be used in function signatures and public
functions - they can be called from other packages.

```move
// module can not be removed from the package
module book::upgradable;

// dependencies can be changed (if they are not used in public signatures)
use std::string::String;
use sui::event; // can be removed

// public structs can not be removed and can't be changed
public struct Book has key {
    id: UID,
    title: String,
}

// public structs can not be removed and can't be changed
public struct BookCreated has copy, drop {
    /* ... */
}

// public functions can not be removed and their signature can never change
// but the implementation can be changed
public fun create_book(ctx: &mut TxContext): Book {
    create_book_internal(ctx)

    // can be removed and changed
    event::emit(BookCreated {
        /* ... */
    })
}

// package-visibility functions can be removed and changed
public(package) fun create_book_package(ctx: &mut TxContext): Book {
    create_book_internal(ctx)
}

// entry functions can be removed and changed as long as they're not public
entry fun create_book_entry(ctx: &mut TxContext): Book {
    create_book_internal(ctx)
}

// private functions can be removed and changed
fun create_book_internal(ctx: &mut TxContext): Book {
    abort 0
}
```

<!--
## Using entry and friend functions

TODO: Add a section about entry and friend functions
-->

## Versioning objects

<!-- This practice is for function version locking based on a shared state -->

To discard previous versions of the package, the objects can be versioned. As long as the object
contains a version field, and the code which uses the object expects and asserts a specific version,
the code can be force-migrated to the new version. Normally, after an upgrade, admin functions can
be used to update the version of the shared state, so that the new version of code can be used, and
the old version aborts with a version mismatch.

```move
module book::versioned_state;

const EVersionMismatch: u64 = 0;

const VERSION: u8 = 1;

/// The shared state (can be owned too)
public struct SharedState has key {
    id: UID,
    version: u8,
    /* ... */
}

public fun mutate(state: &mut SharedState) {
    assert!(state.version == VERSION, EVersionMismatch);
    // ...
}
```

## Versioning configuration with dynamic fields

<!-- This practice is for versioning the contents / structure of objects -->

There's a common pattern in Sui which allows changing the stored configuration of an object while
retaining the same object signature. This is done by keeping the base object simple and versioned
and adding an actual configuration object as a dynamic field. Using this _anchor_ pattern, the
configuration can be changed with package upgrades while keeping the same base object signature.

```move
module book::versioned_config;

use sui::vec_map::VecMap;
use std::string::String;

/// The base object
public struct Config has key {
    id: UID,
    version: u16
}

/// The actual configuration
public struct ConfigV1 has store {
    data: Bag,
    metadata: VecMap<String, String>
}

// ...
```

## Modular architecture

This section is coming soon!

<!-- TODO: add two patterns for modular architecture: object capability (SuiFrens) and witness registry (SuiNS) -->


<!-- FILE: guides/building-against-limits.md -->

# Building Against Limits

To guarantee the safety and security of the network, Sui has certain limits and restrictions. These
limits are in place to prevent abuse and to ensure that the network remains stable and efficient.
This guide provides an overview of these limits and restrictions, and how to build your application
to work within them.

The limits are defined in the protocol configuration and are enforced by the network. If any of the
limits are exceeded, the transaction will either be rejected or aborted. The limits, being a part of
the protocol, can only be changed through a network upgrade.

## Transaction Size

The size of a transaction is limited to 128KB. This includes the size of the transaction payload,
the size of the transaction signature, and the size of the transaction metadata. If a transaction
exceeds this limit, it will be rejected by the network.

## Object Size

The size of an object is limited to 256KB. This includes the size of the object data. If an object
exceeds this limit, it will be rejected by the network. While a single object cannot bypass this
limit, for more extensive storage options, one could use a combination of a base object with other
attached to it using dynamic fields (eg Bag).

## Single Pure Argument Size

The size of a single pure argument is limited to 16KB. A transaction argument bigger than this limit
will result in execution failure. So in order to create a vector of more than ~500 addresses (given
that a single address is 32 bytes), it needs to be joined dynamically either in Transaction Block or
in a Move function. Standard functions like `vector::append()` can join two vectors of ~16KB
resulting in a ~32KB of data as a single value.

## Maximum Number of Objects (and Dynamic Fields) Created

The maximum number of objects that can be created in a single transaction is 2048. If a transaction
attempts to create more than 2048 objects, it will be rejected by the network. This also affects
[dynamic fields](./../programmability/dynamic-fields.md), as both the key and the value are objects.
So the maximum number of [dynamic fields](./../programmability/dynamic-fields.md) that can be
created in a single transaction is 1000. The limitation applies to dynamic object fields as well.

## Maximum Number of Dynamic Fields Accessed

The maximum number of dynamic fields that can be accessed in a single transaction is 1000. If a
transaction attempts to access more than 1000 dynamic fields, it will be rejected by the network.

## Maximum Number of Events

The maximum number of events that can be emitted in a single transaction is 1024. If a transaction
attempts to emit more than 1024 events, it will be aborted.


<!-- FILE: guides/better-error-handling.md -->

# Better Error Handling

Whenever execution encounters an abort, transaction fails and abort code is returned to the caller.
Move VM returns the module name that aborted the transaction and the abort code. This behavior is
not fully transparent to the caller of the transaction, especially when a single function contains
multiple calls to the same function which may abort. In this case, the caller will not know which
call aborted the transaction, and it will be hard to debug the issue or provide meaningful error
message to the user.

```move
module book::module_a;

use book::module_b;

public fun do_something() {
    let field_1 = module_b::get_field(1); // may abort with 0
    /* ... a lot of logic ... */
    let field_2 = module_b::get_field(2); // may abort with 0
    /* ... some more logic ... */
    let field_3 = module_b::get_field(3); // may abort with 0
}
```

The example above illustrates the case when a single function contains multiple calls which may
abort. If the caller of the `do_something` function receives an abort code `0`, it will be hard to
understand which call to `module_b::get_field` aborted the transaction. To address this problem,
there are common patterns that can be used to improve error handling.

## Rule 1: Handle All Possible Scenarios

It is considered a good practice to provide a safe "check" function that returns a boolean value
indicating whether an operation can be performed safely. If the `module_b` provides a function
`has_field` that returns a boolean value indicating whether a field exists, the `do_something`
function can be rewritten as follows:

```move
module book::module_a;

use book::module_b;

const ENoField: u64 = 0;

public fun do_something() {
    assert!(module_b::has_field(1), ENoField);
    let field_1 = module_b::get_field(1);
    /* ... */
    assert!(module_b::has_field(2), ENoField);
    let field_2 = module_b::get_field(2);
    /* ... */
    assert!(module_b::has_field(3), ENoField);
    let field_3 = module_b::get_field(3);
}
```

By adding custom checks before each call to `module_b::get_field`, the developer of the `module_a`
takes control over the error handling. And it allows implementing the second rule.

## Rule 2: Abort with Different Codes

The second trick, once the abort codes are handled by the caller module, is to use different abort
codes for different scenarios. This way, the caller module can provide a meaningful error message to
the user. The `module_a` can be rewritten as follows:

```move
module book::module_a;

use book::module_b;

const ENoFieldA: u64 = 0;
const ENoFieldB: u64 = 1;
const ENoFieldC: u64 = 2;

public fun do_something() {
    assert!(module_b::has_field(1), ENoFieldA);
    let field_1 = module_b::get_field(1);
    /* ... */
    assert!(module_b::has_field(2), ENoFieldB);
    let field_2 = module_b::get_field(2);
    /* ... */
    assert!(module_b::has_field(3), ENoFieldC);
    let field_3 = module_b::get_field(3);
}
```

Now, the caller module can provide a meaningful error message to the user. If the caller receives an
abort code `0`, it can be translated to "Field 1 does not exist". If the caller receives an abort
code `1`, it can be translated to "Field 2 does not exist". And so on.

## Rule 3: Return `bool` Instead of `assert`

A developer is often tempted to add a public function that would assert all the conditions and abort
the execution. However, it is a better practice to create a function that returns a boolean value
instead. This way, the caller module can handle the error and provide a meaningful error message to
the user.

```move
module book::some_app_assert;

const ENotAuthorized: u64 = 0;

public fun do_a() {
    assert_is_authorized();
    // ...
}

public fun do_b() {
    assert_is_authorized();
    // ...
}

/// Don't do this
public fun assert_is_authorized() {
    assert!(/* some condition */ true, ENotAuthorized);
}
```

This module can be rewritten as follows:

```move
module book::some_app;

const ENotAuthorized: u64 = 0;

public fun do_a() {
    assert!(is_authorized(), ENotAuthorized);
    // ...
}

public fun do_b() {
    assert!(is_authorized(), ENotAuthorized);
    // ...
}

public fun is_authorized(): bool {
    /* some condition */ true
}

// a private function can still be used to avoid code duplication for a case
// when the same condition with the same abort code is used in multiple places
fun assert_is_authorized() {
    assert!(is_authorized(), ENotAuthorized);
}
```

Utilizing these three rules will make the error handling more transparent to the caller of the
transaction, and it will allow other developers to use custom abort codes in their modules.


<!-- FILE: guides/code-quality-checklist.md -->

# Code Quality Checklist

The rapid evolution of the Move language and its ecosystem has rendered many older practices
outdated. This guide serves as a checklist for developers to review their code and ensure it aligns
with current best practices in Move development. Please read carefully and apply as many
recommendations as possible to your code.

## Code Organization

Some of the issues mentioned in this guide can be fixed by using
[Move Formatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysten/prettier-plugin-move) either as a CLI tool,
or [as a CI check](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/move-formatter), or
[as a plugin for VSCode (Cursor)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mysten.prettier-move).

## Package Manifest

### Use Right Edition

All of the features in this guide require Move 2024 Edition, and it has to be specified in the
package manifest.

```toml
[package]
name = "my_package"
edition = "2024.beta" # or (just) "2024"
```

### Implicit Framework Dependency

Starting with Sui 1.45 you no longer need to specify framework dependency in the `Move.toml`:

```toml
# old, pre 1.45
[dependencies]
Sui = { ... }

# modern day, Sui, Bridge, MoveStdlib and SuiSystem are imported implicitly!
[dependencies]
```

### Prefix Named Addresses

If your package has a generic name (e.g., `token`) – especially if your project includes multiple
packages – make sure to add a prefix to the named address:

```toml
# bad! not indicative of anything, and can conflict
[addresses]
math = "0x0"

# good! clearly states project, unlikely to conflict
[addresses]
my_protocol_math = "0x0"
```

## Imports, Module and Constants

### Using Module Label

```move
// bad: increases indentation, legacy style
module my_package::my_module {
    public struct A {}
}

// good!
module my_package::my_module;

public struct A {}
```

### No Single `Self` in `use` Statements

```move
// correct, member + self import
use my_package::other::{Self, OtherMember};

// bad! `{Self}` is redundant
use my_package::my_module::{Self};

// good!
use my_package::my_module;
```

### Group `use` Statements with `Self`

```move
// bad!
use my_package::my_module;
use my_package::my_module::OtherMember;

// good!
use my_package::my_module::{Self, OtherMember};
```

### Error Constants are in `EPascalCase`

```move
// bad! all-caps are used for regular constants
const NOT_AUTHORIZED: u64 = 0;

// good! clear indication it's an error constant
const ENotAuthorized: u64 = 0;
```

### Regular Constant are `ALL_CAPS`

```move
// bad! PascalCase is associated with error consts
const MyConstant: vector<u8> = b"my const";

// good! clear indication that it's a constant value
const MY_CONSTANT: vector<u8> = b"my const";
```

## Structs

### Capabilities are Suffixed with `Cap`

```move
// bad! if it's a capability, add a `Cap` suffix
public struct Admin has key, store {
    id: UID,
}

// good! reviewer knows what to expect from type
public struct AdminCap has key, store {
    id: UID,
}
```

### No `Potato` in Names

```move
// bad! it has no abilities, we already know it's a Hot-Potato type
public struct PromisePotato {}

// good!
public struct Promise {}
```

### Events Should Be Named in Past Tense

```move
// bad! not clear what this struct does
public struct RegisterUser has copy, drop { user: address }

// good! clear, it's an event
public struct UserRegistered has copy, drop { user: address }
```

### Use Positional Structs for Dynamic Field Keys + `Key` Suffix

```move
// not as bad, but goes against canonical style
public struct DynamicField has copy, drop, store {}

// good! canonical style, Key suffix
public struct DynamicFieldKey() has copy, drop, store;
```

## Functions

### No `public entry`, Only `public` or `entry`

```move
// bad! entry is not required for a function to be callable in a transaction
public entry fun do_something() { /* ... */ }

// good! public functions are more permissive, can return value
public fun do_something_2(): T { /* ... */ }
```

### Write Composable Functions for PTBs

```move
// bad! not composable, harder to test!
public fun mint_and_transfer(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    /* ... */
    transfer::transfer(nft, ctx.sender());
}

// good! composable!
public fun mint(ctx: &mut TxContext): NFT { /* ... */ }

// good! intentionally not composable
entry fun mint_and_keep(ctx: &mut TxContext) { /* ... */ }
```

### Objects Go First (Except for Clock)

```move
// bad! hard to read!
public fun call_app(
    value: u8,
    app: &mut App,
    is_smth: bool,
    cap: &AppCap,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) { /* ... */ }

// good!
public fun call_app(
    app: &mut App,
    cap: &AppCap,
    value: u8,
    is_smth: bool,
    clock: &Clock,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
) { /* ... */ }
```

### Capabilities Go Second

```move
// bad! breaks method associativity
public fun authorize_action(cap: &AdminCap, app: &mut App) { /* ... */ }

// good! keeps Cap visible in the signature and maintains `.calls()`
public fun authorize_action(app: &mut App, cap: &AdminCap) { /* ... */ }
```

### Getters Named After Field + `_mut`

```move
// bad! unnecessary `get_`
public fun get_name(u: &User): String { /* ... */ }

// good! clear that it accesses field `name`
public fun name(u: &User): String { /* ... */ }

// good! for mutable references use `_mut`
public fun details_mut(u: &mut User): &mut Details { /* ... */ }
```

## Function Body: Struct Methods

### Common Coin Operations

```move
// bad! legacy code, hard to read!
let paid = coin::split(&mut payment, amount, ctx);
let balance = coin::into_balance(paid);

// good! struct methods make it easier!
let balance = payment.split(amount, ctx).into_balance();

// even better (in this example - no need to create temporary coin)
let balance = payment.balance_mut().split(amount);

// also can do this!
let coin = balance.into_coin(ctx);
```

### Do Not Import `std::string::utf8`

```move
// bad! unfortunately, very common!
use std::string::utf8;

let str = utf8(b"hello, world!");

// good!
let str = b"hello, world!".to_string();

// also, for ASCII string

let value = opt.destroy_or!(abort ECannotBeEmpty);
```

## Loops -> Macros

### Do Operation N Times

```move
// bad! hard to read!
let mut i = 0;
while (i < 32) {
    do_action();
    i = i + 1;
};

32u8.do!(|_| do_action());
```

### New Vector From Iteration

```move
// harder to read!
let mut i = 0;
let mut elements = vector[];
while (i < 32) {
    elements.push_back(i);
    i = i + 1;
};

// easy to read!
vector::tabulate!(32, |i| i);
```

### Do Operation on Every Element of a Vector

```move
// bad!
let mut i = 0;
while (i < vec.length()) {
    call_function(&vec[i]);
    i = i + 1;
};

// good!
vec.do_ref!(|e| call_function(e));
```

### Destroy a Vector and Call a Function on Each Element

// bad!
while (!vec.is_empty()) {
    call(vec.pop_back());
};

// good!
vec.destroy!(|e| call(e));
```

### Fold Vector Into a Single Value

```move
// bad!
let mut aggregate = 0;
let mut i = 0;

while (i < source.length()) {
    aggregate = aggregate + source[i];
    i = i + 1;
};

// good!
let aggregate = source.fold!(0, |acc, v| {
    acc + v
});
```

### Filter Elements of the Vector

> Note: `T: drop` in the `source` vector

```move
// bad!
let mut filtered = [];
let mut i = 0;
while (i < source.length()) {
    if (source[i] > 10) {
        filtered.push_back(source[i]);
    };
    i = i + 1;
};

// good!
let filtered = source.filter!(|e| e > 10);
```

## Other

### Ignored Values In Unpack Can Be Ignored Altogether

```move
// bad! very sparse!
let MyStruct { id, field_1: _, field_2: _, field_3: _ } = value;
id.delete();

// good! 2024 syntax
let MyStruct { id, .. } = value;
id.delete();
```

## Testing

### Merge `#[test]` and `#[expected_failure(...)]`

```move
// bad!
#[test]
#[expected_failure]
fun value_passes_check() {
    abort
}

// good!
#[test, expected_failure]
fun value_passes_check() {
    abort
}
```

### Do Not Clean Up `expected_failure` Tests

```move
// bad! clean up is not necessary
#[test, expected_failure(abort_code = my_app::EIncorrectValue)]
fun try_take_missing_object_fail() {
    let mut test = test_scenario::begin(@0);
    my_app::call_function(test.ctx());
    test.end();
}

// good! easy to see where test is expected to fail
#[test, expected_failure(abort_code = my_app::EIncorrectValue)]
fun try_take_missing_object_fail() {
    let mut test = test_scenario::begin(@0);
    my_app::call_function(test.ctx());

    abort // will differ from EIncorrectValue
}
```

### Do Not Prefix Tests With `test_` in Testing Modules

```move
// bad! the module is already called _tests
module my_package::my_module_tests;

#[test]
fun test_this_feature() { /* ... */ }

// good! better function name as the result
#[test]
fun this_feature_works() { /* ... */ }
```

### Do Not Use `TestScenario` Where Not Necessary

```move
// bad! no need, only using ctx
let mut test = test_scenario::begin(@0);
let nft = app::mint(test.ctx());
app::destroy(nft);
test.end();

// good! there's a dummy context for simple cases
let ctx = &mut tx_context::dummy();
app::mint(ctx).destroy();
```

### Do Not Use Abort Codes in `assert!` in Tests

```move
// bad! may match application error codes by accident
assert!(is_success, 0);

// good!
assert!(is_success);
```

### Use `assert_eq!` Whenever Possible

```move
// bad! old-style code
assert!(result == b"expected_value", 0);

// good! will print both values if fails
use std::unit_test::assert_eq;

assert_eq!(result, expected_value);
```

### Use "Black Hole" `destroy` Function

```move
// bad!
nft.destroy_for_testing();
app.destroy_for_testing();

// good! - no need to define special functions for cleanup
use sui::test_utils::destroy;

destroy(nft);
destroy(app);
```

## Comments

### Doc Comments Start With `///`

```move
// bad! tooling doesn't support JavaDoc-style comments
/**
 * Cool method
 * @param ...
 */
public fun do_something() { /* ... */ }

// good! will be rendered as a doc comment in docgen and IDE's
/// Cool method!
public fun do_something() { /* ... */ }
```

### Complex Logic? Leave a Comment `//`

Being friendly and helping reviewers understand the code!

```move
// good!
// Note: can underflow if a value is smaller than 10.
// TODO: add an `assert!` here
let value = external_call(value, ctx);
```

# Appendix A: Glossary

- Fast Path - term used to describe a transaction that does not involve shared objects, and can be
  executed without the need for consensus.
- Parallel Execution - term used to describe the ability of the Sui runtime to execute transactions
  in parallel, including the ones that involve shared objects.
- Internal Type - type that is defined within the module. Fields of this type can not be accessed
  from outside the module, and, in case of "key"-only abilities, can not be used in `public_*`
  transfer functions.

## Abilities

- key - ability that allows the struct to be used as a key in the storage. On Sui, the key ability
  marks an object and requires the first field to be a `id: UID`.
- store - ability that allows the struct to be stored inside other objects. This ability relaxes
  restrictions applied to internal structs, allowing `public_*` transfer functions to accept them as
  arguments. It also enables the object to be stored as a dynamic field.
- copy - ability that allows the struct to be copied. On Sui, the `copy` ability conflicts with the
  `key` ability, and can not be used together with it.
- drop - ability that allows the struct to be ignored or discarded. On Sui, the `drop` ability
  cannot be used together with the `key` ability, as objects are not allowed to be ignored.

# Install MVR

[Move Registry (MVR)](https://moveregistry.com) is a package manager for Move. It allows anyone to
publish and use published packages in new applications written in Move. Local binary allows
searching packages in the registry as well as installing them as a part of the Sui CLI build
process.

## Installing via suiup

The best way to install MVR is by using [`suiup`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup). Suiup
provides an easy way to update and manage different versions of binaries.

Installation instructions for `suiup` can be found
[in the repository README](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup).

To install Move Registry CLI, run the following command:

```bash
suiup install mvr
```

After installation, Move Registry will be available as `mvr`.

## Download Binary

You can download the latest MVR binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mvr/releases). The binary is available for macOS,
Linux and Windows. Unlike [Sui](./install-sui.md), the MVR binary is not changing between
environments and supports both `testnet` and `mainnet`.

## Install Using Cargo

You can install and build MVR locally by using Cargo (requires Rust)

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/mystenlabs/mvr --branch release mvr
```

## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting the installation process, please refer to the
[Install MVR](https://docs.suins.io/move-registry/tooling/mvr-cli#installation) Guide.

# Open Sourcing Libraries

## Adding Examples

When publishing a package that is intended to be used (an NFT protocol or a library), it is
important to showcase how this package can be used. This is where examples come in handy. There's no
special functionality for examples in Move, however, there are some conventions that are used to
mark examples. First of all, only sources are included into the package bytecode, so any code placed
in a different directory will not be included, but will be tested!

This is why placing examples into a separate `examples/` directory is a good idea.

```bash
sources/
    protocol.move
    library.move
tests/
    protocol_test.move
examples/
    my_example.move
Move.toml
```

# Object Display

Objects on Sui are explicit in their structure and behavior and can be displayed in an
understandable way. However, to support richer metadata for clients, there's a standard and
efficient way of "describing" them to the client - the `Display` object defined in the
[Sui Framework](./sui-framework).

## Background

Historically, there were different attempts to agree on a standard structure of an object so it can
be displayed in a user interface. One of the approaches was to define certain fields in the object
struct which, when present, would be used in the UI. This approach was not flexible enough and
required developers to define the same fields in every object, and sometimes the fields did not make
sense for the object.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/display.move anchor=background

```

If any of the fields contained static data, it would be duplicated in every object. And, since Move
does not have interfaces, it is not possible to know if an object has a specific field without
"manually" checking the object's type, which makes the client fetching more complex.

## Object Display

To address these issues, Sui introduces a standard way of describing an object for display. Instead
of defining fields in the object struct, the display metadata is stored in a separate object, which
is associated with the type. This way, the display metadata is not duplicated, and it is easy to
extend and maintain.

Another important feature of Sui Display is the ability to define templates and use object fields in
those templates. Not only it allows for a more flexible display, but it also frees the developer
from the need to define the same fields with the same names and types in every object.

> The Object Display is natively supported by the
> [Sui Full Node](https://docs.sui.io/guides/operator/sui-full-node), and the client can fetch the
> display metadata for any object if the object type has a Display associated with it.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/display.move anchor=hero

```

## Creator Privilege

While the objects can be owned by accounts and may be a subject to
[True Ownership](./../object/ownership#account-owner-or-single-owner), the Display can be owned by
the creator of the object. This way, the creator can update the display metadata and apply the
changes globally without the need to update every object. The creator can also transfer Display to
another account or even build an application around the object with custom functionality to manage
the metadata.

## Standard Fields

The fields that are supported most widely are:

- `name` - A name for the object. The name is displayed when users view the object.
- `description` - A description for the object. The description is displayed when users view the
  object.
- `link` - A link to the object to use in an application.
- `image_url` - A URL or a blob with the image for the object.
- `thumbnail_url` - A URL to a smaller image to use in wallets, explorers, and other products as a
  preview.
- `project_url` - A link to a website associated with the object or creator.
- `creator` - A string that indicates the object creator.

> Please, refer to the [Sui Documentation](https://docs.sui.io/standards/display) for the most
> up-to-date list of supported fields.

While there's a standard set of fields, the Display object does not enforce them. The developer can
define any fields they need, and the client can use them as they see fit. Some applications may
require additional fields, and omit other, and the Display is flexible enough to support them.

## Working with Display

The `Display` object is defined in the `sui::display` module. It is a generic struct that takes a
phantom type as a parameter. The phantom type is used to associate the `Display` object with the
type it describes. The `fields` of the `Display` object are a `VecMap` of key-value pairs, where the
key is the field name and the value is the field value. The `version` field is used to version the
display metadata, and is updated on the `update_display` call.

```move
module sui::display;

public struct Display<phantom T: key> has key, store {
    id: UID,
    /// Contains fields for display. Currently supported
    /// fields are: name, link, image and description.
    fields: VecMap<String, String>,
    /// Version that can only be updated manually by the Publisher.
    version: u16
}
```

The [Publisher](./publisher) object is required to a new Display, since it serves as the proof of
ownership of type.

## Template Syntax

Currently, Display supports simple string interpolation and can use struct fields (and paths) in its
templates. The syntax is trivial - `{path}` is replaced with the value of the field at the path. The
path is a dot-separated list of field names, starting from the root object in case of nested fields.

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/display.move anchor=nested

```

The Display for the type `LittlePony` above could be defined as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "Just a pony",
  "image_url": "{image_url}",
  "description": "{metadata.description}"
}
```

## Multiple Display Objects

There's no restriction to how many `Display<T>` objects can be created for a specific `T`. However,
the most recently updated `Display<T>` will be used by the full node.

<!-- FILE: programmability/fast-path.md -->

# Fast Path

Due to the object model and the data organization model of Sui, some operations can be performed in
a more efficient and parallelized way. This is called the **fast path**. Transaction that touches
shared state requires consensus because it can be accessed by multiple parties at the same time.
However, if the transaction only touches the private state (owned objects), there is no need for
consensus. This is the fast path.

We have a favorite example for this: a coffee machine and a coffee cup. The coffee machine placed in
the office is a shared resource - everyone can use it, but there can be only one user at a time. The
coffee cup, on the other hand, is a private resource - it belongs to a specific person, and only
that person can use it. To make coffee, one needs to use the coffee machine and wait if there's
someone else using it. However, once the coffee is made and poured into the cup, the person can take
the cup and drink the coffee without waiting for anyone else.

The same principle applies to Sui. If a transaction only touches the private state (the cup with
coffee), it can be executed without consensus. If it touches the shared state (the coffee machine),
it requires consensus. This is the fast path.

## Frozen objects

Consensus is only required for mutating the shared state. If the object is immutable, it is treated
as a "constant" and can be accessed in parallel. Frozen objects can be used to share unchangeable
data between multiple parties without requiring consensus.

## In Practice

```move file=packages/samples/sources/programmability/fast-path.move anchor=main

```

## Special Case: Clock

The `Clock` object with the reserved address `0x6` is a special case of a shared object which cannot
be passed by a mutable reference in a regular transaction. An attempt to do so will not succeed, and
the transaction will be rejected. Because of this limitation, the `Clock` object can only be
accessed immutably, which allows executing transactions in parallel without consensus.

<!-- Add more on why and how -->


<!-- FILE: programmability/object-capability.md -->

# Object Capability

<!-- TBD -->


<!-- FILE: programmability/randomness.md -->

# Randomness

<!--

- Every consensus commit a new random value is generated.
- Beginning of an epoch, validators create a global random value.
- One value is used to derive unique random value per transaction.
- Pseudo-random generator from a seed that is created once per epoch.

Qs:

- How does it work with consensus / parallel execution / fast path? works like a Clock
- Does it lose its unpredictability closer to the end of the epoch. no
- What is the UID of the Random object? 0x8
- 0x8 - Random - 8 is a lucky number
- Do we protect &mut access to 0x8

---

- RandomInner is updated.
- Every consensus commit the value inside is updated

---

- Developers call `new_generator` and pass in the global random object.
- ...which creates the RandomGenerator from the global seed with a fresh object ID.
- The RandomGenerator uses unknown unpredictable random bytes + fresh object UID from a transaction.

- then they use `generate_bytes` or `generate_u64` or any other integer. Or a value in a range.
- random shuffle of a vector.

Notes: pretty dope utility!

---

- 8 ball is a random number generator.


Difficulties:

- If you know the seed, then you can predict the random number.
- Random should not be used in a public function - predictable.
- Random failure is more expensive than a success scenario.
    - one way out is to first calculate randomness and then do a separate expensive operation.
    - they can set a limit to gas for failure scenarios, so the failure never happens.
    -

# Transfer to Object?

The `transfer::transfer` call takes the receiver `address` as the second argument, and while in most
of the cases it is an account address, it can also be an address of an object. In this case,


Module sui::table
A table is a map-like collection. But unlike a traditional collection, it's keys and values are not stored within the Table value, but instead are stored using Sui's object system. The Table struct acts only as a handle into the object system to retrieve those keys and values. Note that this means that Table values with exactly the same key-value mapping will not be equal, with ==, at runtime. For example

let table1 = table::new<u64, bool>();
let table2 = table::new<u64, bool>();
table::add(&mut table1, 0, false);
table::add(&mut table1, 1, true);
table::add(&mut table2, 0, false);
table::add(&mut table2, 1, true);
// table1 does not equal table2, despite having the same entries
assert!(&table1 != &table2);

Struct VecMap
A map data structure backed by a vector. The map is guaranteed not to contain duplicate keys, but entries are not sorted by key--entries are included in insertion order. All operations are O(N) in the size of the map--the intention of this data structure is only to provide the convenience of programming against a map API. Large maps should use handwritten parent/child relationships instead. Maps that need sorted iteration rather than insertion order iteration should also be handwritten.

Constants

This key already exists in the map

const EKeyAlreadyExists: u64 = 0;

This key does not exist in the map

const EKeyDoesNotExist: u64 = 1;

Trying to destroy a map that is not empty

const EMapNotEmpty: u64 = 2;

Trying to access an element of the map at an invalid index

const EIndexOutOfBounds: u64 = 3;

Trying to pop from a map that is empty

const EMapEmpty: u64 = 4;

Trying to construct a map from keys and values of different lengths

const EUnequalLengths: u64 = 5;
Function empty
Create an empty VecMap

public fun empty<K: copy, V>(): sui::vec_map::VecMap<K, V>
Click to open
Implementation
Function insert
Insert the entry key |-> value into self. Aborts if key is already bound in self.

public fun insert<K: copy, V>(self: &mut sui::vec_map::VecMap<K, V>, key: K, value: V)
Click to open
Implementation
Function remove
Remove the entry key |-> value from self. Aborts if key is not bound in self.

public fun remove<K: copy, V>(self: &mut sui::vec_map::VecMap<K, V>, key: &K): (K, V)
Click to open
Implementation
Function pop
Pop the most recently inserted entry from the map. Aborts if the map is empty.

public fun pop<K: copy, V>(self: &mut sui::vec_map::VecMap<K, V>): (K, V)
Click to open
Implementation
Function get_mut
Get a mutable reference to the value bound to key in self. Aborts if key is not bound in self.

public fun get_mut<K: copy, V>(self: &mut sui::vec_map::VecMap<K, V>, key: &K): &mut V
Click to open
Implementation
Function get
Get a reference to the value bound to key in self. Aborts if key is not bound in self.

public fun get<K: copy, V>(self: &sui::vec_map::VecMap<K, V>, key: &K): &V
Click to open
Implementation
Function try_get
Safely try borrow a value bound to key in self. Return Some(V) if the value exists, None otherwise. Only works for a "copyable" value as references cannot be stored in vector.

public fun try_get<K: copy, V: copy>(self: &sui::vec_map::VecMap<K, V>, key: &K): std::option::Option<V>

Click to open
Implementation
Function from_keys_values
Construct a new VecMap from two vectors, one for keys and one for values. The key value pairs are associated via their indices in the vectors, e.g. the key at index i in keys is associated with the value at index i in values. The key value pairs are stored in insertion order (the original vectors ordering) and are not sorted.
