# UnXversal Gas Futures – Final Architecture (Aligned with Core Protocols)

This document reflects the production architecture implemented in `packages/unxversal/sources/gas_futures.move`. It follows the same design principles as `dex`, `options`, and `futures`:

- Admin-permissioned parameters via `synthetics::SynthRegistry` (single source of truth).
- Permissionless market listing with cooldowns.
- Off-chain orderbook/matching; on-chain record/settlement with fees routed to central `treasury`.
- Oracle-normalized, fixed-point math (micro-USD scale) and strict pause/guard rails.

## System Architecture & User Flow Overview

## What we hedge

- Unit of account: micro-USD per gas unit.
- Settlement price source: on-chain Reference Gas Price (RGP, MIST/gas) multiplied by SUI/USD (micro-USD per SUI) from Pyth.
- On-chain function to compute instantaneous micro-USD per gas for sanity checks is provided.

#### **Core Object Hierarchy & Relationships**

**On-chain objects:**
- `GasFuturesRegistry` (shared): global fee params (trade/settlement fees, UNXV discount, maker rebate, bot reward split), listing throttle, dispute window, `treasury_id`.
- `GasFuturesContract` (shared): symbol, contract size (gas units/contract), tick size (micro-USD per gas), expiry, status flags, and metrics (open interest, volume, last trade price).
- `GasPosition` (owned): position with real `Coin<USDC>` margin, side/size, average price, accumulated PnL.

Listing is permissionless (cooldown enforced). Trading/settlement is permissionless.

## Overview

UnXversal Gas Futures introduces a revolutionary derivatives product for hedging Sui blockchain gas price risk, with **special focus on sponsored transaction providers** and institutional gas cost management. This innovative protocol addresses the new risk profile created by Sui's sponsored transactions, where gas stations and sponsors assume concentrated gas cost exposure on behalf of users.

- **Educational Platforms**: Stable gas budgets for learning and tutorial transactions
- **Enterprise Applications**: Corporate gas cost management for employee and customer transactions

## Sponsored Transactions – how it ties together

Sponsored transactions are built by the client (user + sponsor signatures). Gas Futures does not handle gas payments; it hedges their cost:

1. The sponsor estimates gas exposure and opens long positions sized in contracts (gas units/contract × contracts).
2. They continue to sponsor user transactions; they pay SUI gas coins as usual.
3. As gas prices rise, futures PnL is positive; after expiry, they call `settle_gas_position` to realize USDC proceeds, offsetting the SUI outlay. If prices fall, the margin absorbs losses.
4. Any transaction (including opens) may be sponsored; we emit the sponsor address for analytics. All money movement (margin, fees, settlement) is enforced by the contract; bots can submit transactions, but no trust is required.

#### **New Risk Profiles Created by Sponsored Transactions:**

1. **Gas Station Operators**
   - **High Volume, Concentrated Risk**: Process thousands of sponsored transactions daily
   - **Unpredictable Cost Structure**: Gas prices can spike unexpectedly during network congestion
   - **Thin Margins**: Must balance competitive sponsorship fees with volatile operational costs
   - **Capital Requirements**: Need significant gas reserves to maintain service availability

2. **Protocol Sponsors (App-Specific)**
   - **User Acquisition Costs**: Gas expenses directly impact marketing budgets and user acquisition ROI
   - **Seasonal Volatility**: Gaming protocols face higher gas costs during peak usage
   - **Budget Planning**: Need predictable gas costs for annual planning and investor reporting
   - **Competitive Pressure**: Must maintain gasless experiences while managing costs

3. **Enterprise Wildcard Sponsors**
   - **Unlimited Exposure**: Offer unrestricted gas payments to users
   - **Abuse Risk**: Vulnerable to gas cost attacks and unexpected usage spikes
   - **Compliance Requirements**: Need predictable costs for corporate budgeting and SOX compliance
   - **Scale Economics**: Large enterprises need sophisticated hedging for operational efficiency

## Security and Risk Considerations

1. **Oracle Manipulation**: Multi-source gas price validation with real-time monitoring
2. **Network Attacks**: Protection against artificial congestion and gas price manipulation
3. **Settlement Disputes**: Robust arbitration process for gas price disagreements
4. **Liquidity Risk**: Ensure sufficient liquidity for large institutional hedges
5. **Model Risk**: Validation and backtesting of predictive models
6. **Operational Risk**: Reliable gas price feeds and settlement mechanisms
7. **Regulatory Risk**: Compliance with evolving derivatives regulations

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Gas Futures (Month 1-2)
- Deploy gas futures registry and basic contracts (quarterly, monthly)
- Implement gas oracle with multi-source price feeds
- Launch basic hedging functionality for protocols
- Integrate with autoswap for fee processing

### Phase 2: Advanced Analytics (Month 3-4)
- Deploy predictive analytics and machine learning models
- Implement institutional hedging solutions
- Launch seasonal pattern detection and trading
- Add comprehensive risk management tools

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration (Month 5-6)
- Full integration with all UnXversal protocols
- Deploy shared gas pools and cross-protocol optimization
- Launch algorithmic trading and advanced strategies
- Implement gas subsidy programs and efficiency rewards

The UnXversal Gas Futures Protocol represents a groundbreaking innovation in blockchain derivatives, creating the world's first comprehensive gas price risk management solution that provides institutional-grade hedging, predictive analytics, and cost optimization while driving significant UNXV utility through enhanced features and ecosystem-wide gas efficiency improvements.

## Required Bots and Automation

### 1. Market Creation Bots
- **Role:** Create new gas futures contracts at required intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
- **Interaction:** Call on-chain market creation functions; interact with market creation registry.
- **Reward:** Receive a percentage of protocol fees for new market creation (see FEE_REVIEW.md).

### 2. Settlement Bots
- **Role:** Trigger settlement for expiring contracts and process daily mark-to-market.
- **Interaction:** Call on-chain settlement functions; interact with settlement queue.
- **Reward:** Receive a percentage of settlement fees.

### 3. Automation Bots
- **Role:** Automate risk checks, rebalancing, and protocol parameter updates (if allowed).
- **Interaction:** Monitor protocol events, submit transactions as needed.
- **Reward:** Can be incentivized via protocol fees or UNXV boosts.
