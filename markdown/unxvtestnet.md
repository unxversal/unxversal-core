# Unxversal Testnet Rewards Program

**Earn points for every trade, stake, and interaction on Unxversal's testnet. Your activity today shapes your rewards tomorrow.**

## How It Works

Every day at midnight UTC, your on-chain activity gets converted into **reward points** using our comprehensive scoring system. These points determine your tier, leaderboard position, and faucet access - setting you up for future mainnet benefits.

## Ways to Earn Points Daily

### 🎯 **Trading & Market Making** (Highest Rewards)
- **Volume**: Trade on futures, perps, and gas futures. We use square-root scaling, so consistent trading beats occasional whale moves
- **Market Making**: Provide better prices than the market midpoint on limit orders - quality matters more than quantity
- **Profitable Trading**: Only your gains count toward points (losses don't hurt your score, but don't help either)
- **Funding Participation**: Hold positions overnight and participate in funding payments

### 📈 **Options Activity**  
- **Buying Options**: Pay premiums to go long volatility
- **Selling Options**: Collect premiums as a market maker

### 💰 **Lending & Borrowing**
- **Smart Borrowing**: Borrow when utilization is high (shows you're using credit productively)
- **Quality Lending**: Supply liquidity when the market needs it most
- **Liquidations**: Help clean up undercollateralized positions

### ⚠️ **Fair Play Rules**
- **Anti-Wash Trading**: If you trade >60% of your daily volume with the same counterparty, you'll get penalized
- **Organic Activity**: The system rewards genuine usage patterns

## Tier System (7-Day Rolling)

Your tier is based on your **last 7 days of earned points** (referral bonuses don't count):

- 🥉 **Tier 0**: 0+ points (Starting tier)
- 🥈 **Tier 1**: 100k+ points  
- 🥇 **Tier 2**: 500k+ points
- 💎 **Tier 3**: 2.5M+ points
- 🏆 **Tier 4**: 10M+ points
- 👑 **Tier 5**: 40M+ points (Elite)

**Higher tiers unlock:**
- Larger daily USDU faucet allowances after losses
- Longer grace periods before faucet cooldowns
- Recognition and exclusive access opportunities

## Referral Program (3 Levels Deep)

**Invite friends and earn from their success:**

- **Level 1** (Direct referrals): Earn **20%** of their daily points
- **Level 2** (Their referrals): Earn **6%** of their daily points  
- **Level 3** (Third level): Earn **2%** of their daily points

**Rules:**
- ✅ Choose your referrer once (permanent decision)
- ✅ No self-referrals or circular chains
- ✅ Weekly cap: Your referral earnings can't exceed 100% of your own activity
- ✅ Referral bonuses are credited automatically each day

*Example: If your direct referral earns 1,000 points today, you automatically get 200 bonus points added to your daily total.*

## Weekly Leaderboards

Every week resets with fresh competition:
- **Top 1,000** users get exact rankings
- **Everyone else** gets percentile rankings (50th, 75th, 90th, etc.)
- **All-time totals** are tracked separately for long-term recognition

## USDU Faucet Access

Need testnet liquidity? The faucet gives you **up to 100,000 USDU daily**, but with smart risk management:

**How it works:**
1. Your tier determines your daily loss budget ($500 to $50,000)
2. Trade and potentially lose money? No problem, until you hit your tier's limit
3. Hit your loss limit? 1-day cooldown before accessing the faucet again
4. **Higher tiers = higher risk tolerance = more faucet access**

*This system ensures serious users get the liquidity they need while preventing abuse.*

## Getting Started

1. **Connect your wallet** and start trading any Unxversal product
2. **Set a referrer** (optional, but recommended - find someone's referral code)
3. **Use the faucet** to get initial USDU if needed
4. **Trade actively** across different products to maximize point diversity
5. **Check your progress** - points update in real-time

## What This Builds Toward

This testnet phase is **your opportunity to establish yourself** in the Unxversal ecosystem. Your activity, tier progression, and community contributions are all being tracked for future recognition and benefits as we transition to mainnet.

**The most active and highest-quality users today will have the strongest position tomorrow.**
