                        This test validates the complete trade fee calculation and routing system for perpetuals. It sets up a market with specific fee parameters (1% trade fee, 50% maker rebate, 50% UNXV discount), records a fill, and verifies that the math works correctly: taker fee = notional × fee_bps, maker rebate = fee × maker_rebate_bps, UNXV discount = fee × discount_bps. The test confirms that the fee after discount is properly deposited to treasury, market metrics (open_interest, volume, last_trade_price) are updated, and the event mirror captures all fee/discount/rebate fields for external verification.

                        This test ensures that the perpetuals trading system enforces proper price controls to prevent manipulation and errors. It attempts to record a fill with a price that doesn't align to the market's tick size and verifies that the transaction aborts. Additionally, it tests slippage bounds by providing min/max price parameters and confirming that fills outside these bounds are rejected. This protects traders from execution at stale or manipulated prices.

                        This test validates the security of the funding mechanism by ensuring that funding rate calculations can only use the authorized index price feed. It attempts to refresh market funding using an aggregator that doesn't match the whitelisted underlying feed and confirms that the operation aborts. This prevents malicious actors from manipulating funding rates using unauthorized price sources.

                        This test verifies that the market-level pause mechanism works correctly as a safety control. When a specific perpetual market is paused, it should block all trading operations including fills and position management. The test pauses a market and attempts to record a fill, confirming that the operation is rejected, allowing administrators to halt trading on problematic markets while keeping others operational.

                        This test validates the registry-level pause functionality, which serves as a circuit breaker for the entire perpetuals system. When the registry is paused, no new markets can be listed and no operational calls should succeed. The test pauses the registry and attempts to list a new market, verifying that the operation fails, providing administrators with emergency shutdown capabilities.

                        This test validates the funding rate calculation and points reward system for maintenance operations. It sets up a market with trading history, advances time to allow funding refresh, and calls the funding refresh function. The test verifies that the funding rate and direction are computed correctly based on the premium between mark price and index price, capped by the maximum funding rate. It also confirms that the caller receives points for performing this maintenance operation.

                        This comprehensive test validates the complete lifecycle of perpetual positions. It creates a position with specific margin requirements, performs a partial close (verifying proportional margin refund), liquidates another position when underwater (confirming margin seizure), and applies funding to a fresh position. The test uses event mirrors to capture and verify all the emitted state changes, ensuring that position management works correctly across all scenarios.

                        This test validates the bot reward system for trading operations. It configures a trade fee with maker rebate, UNXV discount, and bot split parameters, then records a fill that should result in specific fee routing. The test verifies that after applying discount and rebate, the remaining fee is split between the bot operator and the treasury according to the configured percentages, ensuring proper incentives for bot operators while generating protocol revenue.

                        This test ensures that liquidation operations properly compensate both bot operators and the protocol treasury. It creates an under-collateralized position, triggers liquidation, and verifies that the seized margin is split between the liquidating bot and the treasury according to the configured bot reward percentage. This incentivizes timely liquidation while ensuring the protocol captures appropriate revenue from risk management.

                        This test validates the core trading functionality for gas futures contracts. It records a fill with specific price and size parameters, verifies that the trade fee is calculated correctly and routed to the treasury, and confirms that market metrics (open interest, volume, last price) are updated appropriately. The test uses both SUI and UNXV price feeds to ensure proper fee calculations in the gas futures context, where prices are denominated in micro-USD per gas unit.

The test confirms that the discounted UNXV amount is deposited to epoch reserves while the remaining fee flows to the treasury, and that bot reserves properly accrue UNXV tokens.
